While I certainly found it astonishing how clearly we can see the effects of climate change in our own backyard, I wanted to try to tackle why Santa Barbara is struggling to act on the goals that so many people in this area seem to value. I also think, by extension, this could help us understand why individuals, such as myself, are grappling with a similar issue within ourselves in spite of how confident we are that climate change is caused by our actions.
<br><br>
A few years ago I came to the conclusion that eating meat was inherently immoral based on many of my most deeply held ethical convictions. Yet, I continued to eat meat on a weekly or daily basis. In my AP environmental science class, I learned about the massive environmental impact of meat and how beneficial it would be to switch to a plant-based diet. That very week (and multiple times since then) I tried a vegan diet, but quickly gave up because it was just too hard. My issue is what is colloquially referred to as “moral laziness.” I would say there are far more people who exhibit moral laziness than there are “bad people” who simply don’t care about animal rights or climate change. This ties directly into the section of the article discussing Santa Barabara’s lack of action, in spite of its environmentally friendly reputation. The rationale is quite simple, it is easier to just not. I can write an entire paper about how vegans can save the planet, but next time I come back from a soccer match and I see steak on the menu, I’m going to order it. The same thing goes for these congressmen, they can read the IPCC report on climate change but when the oil lobbyists come knocking on their door and offer them a million-dollar paycheck, they’re going to have a very difficult time turning it down. Just like the controversy over free public parking in Santa Barbara, most people are simply not willing to give up convenience to prevent an “invisible force” like climate change. The fact that the force is “invisible” is actually really important. If some being with inherent authority, like a God, were to tell a specific person that “If you do not stop eating meat, then your city will burn to the ground.” I believe in this situation, anyone would quickly abandon their previous prioritization and become vegetarian. The issue lies in the indirect and somewhat abstract nature of climate change. In my mind, the main issues that cause this 'moral laziness' are as follows. First, the notion that an individual by themselves cannot make a difference (similar to why people don’t vote in elections, as their vote is “meaningless”), second, the fact that you can’t visibly see the harm that you are doing, (you can’t watch the Co2 from your car start fires or fuel hurricanes), and thirdly, that climate change seems so off in the distance that it is not worth giving up things that give us pleasure like eating meat or wearing nice clothes. I am unfortunately guilty of these as much as anyone. I hope that this class will help me overcome this barrier.

Speaking as someone who has similar convictions, I feel like a bit of a fraud- shaming the executives and fossil-fuel companies for their apparent lack of regard and inaction, yet I take little action to make changes either. I'm from Ventura County, and have seen and felt the severe effects of the fires every year like clockwork. The record highs in both winter and summer were noticeable, as was the smaller things like dying front lawns and sprinkler restrictions in response to the drought. It would've been (relatively) simple to shorten my showers, stop eating meats, and drive less frequently. Even now, I could bike everyday but choose to bus instead. So, being that I quite literally have felt the "force" you referenced and still haven't made changes, I have to question where the tipping point will actually be. How far does this have to go before an ordinary person like me makes changes; how much farther for a multi-billion dollar industry? Being as advanced as a species as we are, how can we not overcome the ridiculous trivialities of this "moral laziness"? How can that beautiful cheeseburger staring me down in the dining hall erase any prior consideration of Ken's gut-wrenching lectures from my thoughts?

"Moral laziness" is a disease that plagues this entire world. Often times, the easiest thing to do is simply nothing at all. I too have spent many hours contemplating the benefits of a vegan diet yet I still find it almost impossible to bring myself to resolve to such a change. The analogy that you make between the politician and ourselves is entirely accurate. If I too was in such a position, I would find it hard to turn down such an incentive. 
<br><br>
In many ways, the developments of fossil fuels can be put into the same analogy. Our society has benefited greatly from the advancements set forward by the fossil fuel industry. Put simply, fossil fuels have increased the overall quality of life for all people on this planet by an almost unfathomable degree. Despite this the inherent consequences that our society continues to reap when we burn these fossil fuels will cause unimaginable disasters that will lower the quality of life for all people on this planet for generations to come. While it is true that we have benefited greatly from the development of the coal, oil, and natural gas industries, our society will come to reap far greater benefits if we decide to wean off of their power. If we want to see change in our society, all kinds of people need to abolish their "moral laziness" and come to a greater understanding for the health of our planet.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with this comment and often feel the same way as you do. Before taking Eng 22 last quarter, I was quite unaware of how badly my actions impacted the environment. After learning about things such as eating meat and driving a car does to our environment, I was horrified. I felt as if I needed to make a change to my lifestyle to create an impact. However, as you mentioned, I felt this “moral laziness” as I lived through my daily life. When I saw meat, I would still take it because I wanted to eat it even though I knew it wasn’t good for our environment, thinking that it wouldn’t make it difference because someone else would have eaten it if I hadn’t. When I went back home to the Bay Area over the winter break, I still drove my car everywhere because it was convenient. The area does not have a developed public transportation system and I didn’t want to walk because it took too long to get to places. As a result, I barely did anything to change my lifestyle, not because I didn’t care, but because I was lazy and thought that my actions couldn’t possibly impact our environment THAT much. 
<br><br>
 Another thing you addressed was the invisible force of climate change which is something I also agree with. While we do see in the news about weather changes around the world caused by climate change, rarely do we experience it upfront. The closest we have come to experiencing the consequences of climate change were the wildfires in California. In the Bay Area where I live, the only big inconvenience was the smokey air of the area. I did not personally see or experience the fires which made the whole situation not as real for me. All around the world we hear of the Australian wildfires and Miami floods, but we are not really there to experience it. Thus, we don’t really understand what climate change is actually doing to our planet, which makes us less inclined to take action. I think your comment was very well thought out and was something that needed to be addressed. I also hope to overcome the barrier of this “moral laziness” through this class.
<br><hr>
I very much agree with you. I hear from so many climate positive articles and podcasts, as well as people who have switched to plant-based diets, insisting on the list of benefits that come from cutting off meat in the diet. However, I, just like many other people who are environmentally conscious and friendly, cannot imagine myself cutting all meat out of my diet and switch to an entirely plant-based diet. I would say it is actually very hard to completely cut something out of your diet, especially if you have been eating it ever since you can remember.
<br><br>
It also is not the change in taste and diet that people would consider. Just like you said, individuals don't believe that their change, the lack of one person eating meat, will have any significant impact on improving the environment and climate crisis. I kind of relate this to the problem of lack of voter turnout. Just like an individual thinking that their habits will not make a significant impact for the climate crisis in any certain way, the same applies to a single vote. Many people do not voice their political power to vote because they believe that a single vote will not change election results. In addition, many people also believe that even if they switch off of each meat, the meat that they would've eaten would be used in a different way, no matter what. Therefore, there are no fewer animals raised, no less CO2 released, and that individual continues their current diet. 
<br><br>
In addition, I believe that even if you cannot cut meat out of your diet, there are other ways to help with the environmental crisis. Waste less water by taking shorter showers, waste less food, conserve electricity, refuse single-use plastic, and even more daily habits that could help improve the climate crisis bit by bit, and do not significantly affect living habits and diet.
<br><hr>

I agree with you to the fullest extent, as myself as well fall victim to your own same predicament. Coming from Southern California myself, where my own family and home were threatened by a wildfire years back, I have grown much more conscious of the devastating effects and the terrible future to follow is we don't try and halt the climate crisis. Yet, even with the knowledge on the foreseeable dangers of the climate change, we hardly budge until the threat is at our own face. As Jason Xie stated in another response, "moral laziness" is often something we all face because of the fact that we see that the climate change in it's own right, isn't as important as what we are currently doing because of the three major reasons you listed below, with people not feeling motivated knowing that if they change at all it won't have a major impact, the invisible consequences of our actions, and that the climate change doesn't appeal to the average individual as an impending epidemic. It won't be apparent until the danger is blatantly in our face. 
<br><br>
However, since taking English 22 last quarter with Hiltner, my overall view of my actions have grown a bit more than ever before as Hiltner, then, opened my eyes to what eve the smallest of valuables I take for granted have as a devastating effect to the entirety of the world which was apparent in the film he gave to us called "The True Cost". Even now, after just a few lecture into English 23 has my vision of my actions and view of the world changed through Hiltner's lectures, and maybe at some point enlightenment to the fullest of my will to change for the better good. I believe at some point in our lives we will see the far greater benefits that will come through newer and greener lifestyles, whether it is through a natural disaster like the 1969 Santa Barbara spill that makes us become environmentally conscious or when it's all too late. 
<br><br>


Now on the article, it is quite concerning to see that both Santa Barbara county and Ventura county are witnessing such major rise in temperature, especially with prevalence of agriculture and wildlife in both of these counties. Being from Riverside, once you break that hill that leads you right into to Ventura county and later on Santa Barbara, the agricultural landscapes dominates the land and plays a significant roll in these counties, yet they're at the great danger of rising temperatures which leads to crop failures, people losing jobs in the agricultural business sector and even a reduction of food all over the greater United States as California, as stated produces the most amount of produce in the United States. It would lead to a inevitable domino effect that would result in many people starving, losing their jobs and homes because of the work in the fields. With crop failures leads to dry soil, with dry shrubbery that would dot the land and be fire starters for future wild fires that could ravage the lives of the many in  the United States. And I understand it has gotten bad to the point that it has become a greater norm to relate wildfires and California together as something that happens on an everyday bases and that's the issue we face, everyone doesn't take the situation seriously until their lives are at risk.

Your perspective is very special and I appreciate it. You mentioned “moral laziness” and related this concept to people’s attitude toward global warming. You said “there are far more people who exhibit moral laziness than there are “bad people” who simply don’t care about animal rights or climate change.” Indeed, most people realize what is happening around us but do not take actions to change the situation. You also listed some reasons to explain why “moral laziness” would happen, and your analysis made sense to me. I used to consider climate change as an issue that has little relation with me. Because climate change is a global event, and I am unable to make a difference on this issue without others’ help. Also, I cannot see the impact of global warming immediately. Climate change seems so far away. I don't see any necessity to take action. I think this class is a bridge which connects us to this global issue. I hope all of us can over this barrier in the future.

As a girl born and raised outside California, it is true that I never really grow an image of how California, the place of sunshine and beach in my mind, are suffering from climate change. I will never believe that coastline will start to shrink and the tornados raging along coastlines merely seeing the staggering data in paper and online. Last year in December, I witnessed the cape fire which made the whole night sky red, but even then I didn't realize that those wild fires are not happening for no reason and from nowhere, it is the climate change that made them more frequent and more severe. It is really sad seeing or even imaging the beautiful California will lose its glow as a out-state resident, I wish we could do more to at least slow down the pace in which the beautiful scenes fading away due to climate crisis.<br><hr>

I totally agree with what was said by the author of this comment. Things like environment protection, climate crisis, and recycling are all kind of common knowledge today. Everyone in the world, even those primary school students like my little cousin, know all these general knowledge. However, I think the problem is that, just as what the author said, how many people are actually do all these things in their daily lives. Similar to vegan diet, really do all these things continuously is a pretty hard thing because there are too many influences in this world, such as commercial issues. Sometimes my little cousin even do better on something like saving energy or saving water, because that is what his teacher taught him to do that he do not have too many concerns about other things. 
<br><br>
In my mind, an important reason why people feel hard to actually keep doing all these things is that we do not actually realize the urgency of doing all this small things, and there is a very little difference can be see for a person of doing small things to protect the environment. Therefore, videos like these on YouTube are pretty good to secure people and to  propaganda the emergency of taking actions immediately to save the future of earth and ourselves.

As much as the romantic in me believes that every person has the capacity to care about these morally challenging issues, and the conviction to make personal sacrifices in response, I'm afraid I agree that most people just don't want to. I think you're touching on a critical component of climate inaction that often gets overlooked. Much of the discussion surrounding the climate debate is about the rift between the denialists/skeptics and those who believe in climate change. However, we often let those who "believe" in climate change get away with not doing anything about it, because believing is better than nothing. This is something I'm confident many people (especially young adults) struggle with - knowing that there is a problem and having some idea of the solutions, but lacking the conviction and accountability to take action. Too many people are unwilling to make compromises because we lack the sociopolitical and systematic support to encourage climate-friendly behaviors. A solution then, would require changes at the community and national level that give the individual more incentive to choose these behaviors. Whether its monetary incentive, social pressure, punishment, etc, most people need at least a little push in the right direction.

I totally agree with your point regarding "moral laziness", humanity has been struggling to fight this issue, it could sometimes arguably that this issue is part of human nature. But, can you really blame people for having this "moral laziness"?. Yes, it is easy for us to say something verbally, but it is difficult for us to put it in action, especially if it doesn't help our personal desires and businesses. This is why, I believe we are completely blind about the situation of climate change. Climate change is here and is already happening. Yet, the human race still acts like it doesn't. Humanity often procrastinate on things like this because they do not think its severe or at least have not felt the desolating consequence of Climate Change. There are a lot of factors that could contribute to this and you have said most of it. Also, I believe that because of our way living, thus, humanity being "spoon-fed" has a great impact to this. Some of us are lucky enough to live in a free and rich country like the United States, but what about the people from across the world in which they live in an undeveloped country and have no means of resources or financial support? They are in deep danger when calamity comes. Hence, for us people who are fortunate enough, we are taking this issue lightly and taking what we have for granted. Moral laziness is pretty much a common thing for us. In fact, we all go through it, the unfortunate truth is that we never listen. Even if we do, its too late or rather we have already experienced the consequences. This whole issue of climate change could be fix if we only commit ourselves in making changes by putting it in action. Personally, I realized that Planet Earth is like our parent warning humanity, it's kids to not have bad habits or they will regret it in the end. At first, Humanity as kids, obey and listen to it when they see signs about climate change, but as time flies, humanity is caught up to their own personal lives and other issues happening around them that they often forget about the rant that Planet Earth told them, thus, the Climate Change. 
<br><br>

I could definitely see your point regarding politicians disregarding the issue of Climate Change, I am with you on this. Politicians would rather live of the high of being filthy rich, rather than have a clean environment. This is really unfortunate for us, especially with Trump administration believing that Climate Change is a haux, which resulted on us abandoning the Paris Agreement to minimize co2 emission. I understand that production must go on to produce profit, but most of these politicians are ignorant enough to not see that Climate change is happening all around the world and people are already suffering from the consequences of constant polluting and fossil fuel burning. Our politicians need to know that if they do not take Climate change seriously, they will see their Benjamin Franklin notes and their castle-like homes to be burned in to the ground caused by their own ignorance, illustrated by the catastrophic wildfires. Overall, I believe that we could all deal with our "moral laziness" and our "economic greed" by simply working on ourselves at first, it is going to be a process for us to completely transition to alternatives just to save our Planet, but we have to start. I believe its time for us to stop contemplating about Climate change and for us to do something with it. Humanity could start off by simply spreading the word, like this course do and educate people regarding Climate Change. Also, our planet is also in need of new advisors and new leaders that will listen to the public about Climate Change. For this reason, we must educate ourselves and do our research, so we could pick and influence our leaders. In which it would be a great step for humanity in conquering Climate Change

Reading your comment, I found myself nodding my head in agreement. I have also watched documentaries that discuss the meat industry and its large contribution to pollution. I've read books that discuss the benefits of switching to a plant-based diet, whether it be on our health and the environment. And each time, I've also thought I could become vegan but it was always short-lived. Despite my frustrations knowing that climate change is happening and how one beef patty is 660 gallons of water, it's hard to not eat meat when you're not the one cooking. Before living on my own, I ate whatever my parents made, and a lot of our cultural dishes are meat-based.  Now in Isla Vista, I try to eat less meat but it's because I have freedom in what groceries I buy and access to an online platform where we can share all kinds of vegetarian recipes, which my parents are not that good with because they're more old-school and like to do things from memory. However, recently visiting home over break, I noticed that my parents were starting to be more cautious with what they buy. Although it's small changes like switching from whole milk to oat milk, it was cool to see and when I asked "why?" my mom told me she remembered what I told her and did a little more research on it. You made a comparison between meat-lovers and money-hungry congressmen, and I was thinking that if maybe they are truly made aware of the consequences of climate change, it's not impossible to switch positions for the greater good, even if it's in a small way. And I'm not trying to say that they are the exact same, however, my parents are pretty traditional but if they can do it, then why can't congressmen make a change if it is for an even greater good

Your comment is quite relatable. I to find myself in a never ending battle with "moral laziness", but might add that there are degrees to this moral laziness. I personally do not eat meat, however I do participate in other unsustainable habits: Eating poultry, dairy (once in a while), eating fish, driving, over consumption of materials, and blatant disregard of political news. I think my level of "moral laziness" however is much lower than that of a congressmen who accepts the money of a fossil fuel oil lobbyist. 
<br><br>
There is a reason why we have elected officials, to guide our nation in the right direction, unfortunately our country has fallen prey to powerful interests that want to keep us in the dark for as long as possible. Of course individuals like yourself and I have a responsibility to be as sustainable as we must to avert this crisis as much as we can, but there comes a point where our "moral laziness" is surpassed by the blatant greed of these congressmen or corporations. And to add to my point, the fossil fuel industry knew of climate change well before the general population and yet they proceeded with business as usual - at the expense of the planet. So by far, I feel like their moral laziness is much greater that yours or mine.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment.  Even though many people are aware of climate change and know how they as an individual can help to slow and stop climate change, they will not take those steps simply because they believe their efforts will not take effect.  I know that taking shorter showers and eating less meat will help the environment, but I still do not actually act on those beliefs because I never consider whether a decision I make is good for the environment.  Watching documentaries and reading articles about how humanity has damaged the environment will make you want to do whatever you can to save the environment, but once the documentary/article has ended, you resume life as usual and do not make the lifestyle changes you had just been considering.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with everything that Evan said. I was just talking with some of my friends who are also taking this course that after watching Before the Flood I wanted to stop eating meat (I also felt this way after watching Cowpiracy). Not only have I always been an animal lover but knowing how much of an effect it has on the environment makes me want to stop even more. I do care and I do want to be apart of this movement to stop climate change but it is going to be difficult. It was mentioned in the article how liberal and environmentally friendly the Santa Barbara County is yet no action has been taken to fix the issue. Like Evan already stated, this is not because we do not care. It is just going to be a really big challenge to get such a large group of people to stop eating meat and driving cars like we have for our entire lives. It is a known fact that the United States is home to some very lazy people. I am not ashamed of the fact that I fall under that category. For as long as I can remember I have always lived my life thinking about how to go about things in the most convenient way possible. The problem with this is now it seems that whatever is more convenient is also more harmful to our planet. Rather than stopping everything cold turkey I think a better plan would be to ease into these new ways of life.

Your comment in particular was extremely thought provoking, especially when I read the words "moral laziness." I, too, believe I am an environmentally-conscious citizen. I use reusable grocery bags at the store, a reusable water bottle throughout my day, and try to turn off the lights in my apartment as much as possible. I even carry around a reusable straw so that I can enjoy an iced coffee from Starbucks without feeling the guilt of the environmental harms of plastic. However, since I took AP Environmental Science in high school, I have been aware that cutting out meat is the most efficient way to save our planet from climate change since beef production emits the most greenhouse gases, as confirmed through Climate Crisis 101. Yet, I call myself an environmentalist when I continue to consume red meat. The "moral laziness" is what takes over--yes, I want to save the environment, but it definitely is hard to say no to a burger or a twelve ounce steak. This parallel to how many people view climate change is extremely accurate, in a sense where it depicts the want to take action, but lacks any real effort. When I came to UCSB last year, I thought that Santa Barbara was environmentally friendly, with all of the hydration stations to refill reusable water bottles, compostable plates and utensils at dining areas, and even the option to use less water to flush the toilet in most of the bathrooms here. I was shocked to read in the article that this county has had a dramatic increase in temperature. I felt like everything I saw on this campus was a scam. My moral compass tells me to become a vegan and stop driving gasoline cars. However, these two are unreasonable for an average girl like me. Immediately becoming vegan is similar to never going to the gym, but deciding to go by starting off with seven days a week. It's irrational and the plan is almost set up to fail. Thus, I have decided to become a reducetarian. I've stated this in other comments on videos that also pertained to the impacts of eating meat. If I can cut meat out of my diet three days a week, I believe I am making the right step towards a cleaner future than eating meat every day. My weekly meat consumption would almost be cut in half, thus dramatically decreasing my carbon footprint. In terms of driving a gasoline car, I simply cannot afford to buy a new electric car at this moment. It's unreasonable to expect everybody to be able to afford these luxury switches. The best I can do right now is carpool everywhere, and take as much public transport as I can. I hope that one day I'll be able to drive a car that runs on renewable energy to further reduce my carbon footprint.

<br><hr>
When I was reading the article today, I too was trying to wrap my head around why myself and so many others who believe in the dangers of climate change neglect taking any action. The article spoke of many tragedies such as the Thomas Fire which burned 281,000 acres of land. It also showcased shocking facts like the fact that Santa Barbara’s average temperature has risen 2.3 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times. These facts are shocking and all, but I’ve still done little to improve my carbon footprint. Your idea of “moral laziness” perfectly explains how I feel; when I hear about these tragedies I want to contribute, yet I continue to use carbon excessively. At the end of your comment, you mentioned three reasons why you believed we all fall into a pattern of “moral laziness”. I agree with all three, but especially want to focus on the first reason, feeling like you can’t make a difference. Although one person’s carbon footprint won’t end up making a difference, I believe that our actions and voice can. Just the other day I was approached by a group of students near the UCen. They asked me if I’d want to sign an anti-fracking petition and I immediately said yes. The more awareness and activism we can spread, the more pressure we put on politicians and others in power to make changes to the way things are. This in my opinion is the most important focus. The moral laziness of a politician who votes against renewable energy funding and a carbon tax in exchange for heaps of money has a WAY bigger impact than any one of us driving a car. We all fall into a pattern of moral laziness so we can’t just expect politicians and corporations to act better than us, we have to make them. Through increased awareness and activism, we can get laws passed, such as a carbon tax, that would then force most people to reduce their carbon footprint.
<br><hr>
While reading the article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit '' I too made the conclusion about your point on convenience. To put it bluntly we usually take the easy way out and that is what is happening here as well. No matter the reputation of a county’s environmental action statistics are everything. As every article, film, or lecture we have seen in English 23 thus far this article was no different. It was as alarming and eye opening as the rest. I mean this positively of course, as I believe the shock factor of the climate crisis is a very effective strategy to wake people up to the reality of the disasters of not only our climate as a whole but how it is affecting our home. 
<br><br>
The fact that Santa Barbara has seen the majority of its disasters only in the last couple years is terrifying. You would think that this would cause major action. But, I can not agree more with the two examples of not seeing it, and not believing a single person can make the change. It is easy to believe in something when you see the Pacific coast garbage patch, or the eroding cliffs of our very own Del Playa Drive but when faced with the facts of our personal carbon footprint it is a hard thought to wrap your mind around. I too am guilty of this and I as well hope to make personal changes by learning in this class what a single person’s effect on the climate is. I hope that when that information settles in and I begin to see the effect I have made throughout my lifetime that I can make a difference in my future.
<br><hr>
You did a great job highlighting a massive societal issue.  Living a sustainable life is currenlty just too inconvinient for a lot of people. I had an internship at a large aerospace engineering firm this summer. Here I worked to help make production processes more environmentally friendly. I struggled. I found a huge issue is, simply put as, engineers just seemed to not give a fuck. They are there to build what they need and they have to build prototype after prototype and materials go to waste all the time. 
<br><br>

Like you said, it’s really hard to preach an issue to people like these engineers who simply have their job to do. But I found that they simply had not had time to focus away from their huge engineering feets to acknowledge that they could use an iPad for a scale drawing instead of a huge piece of paper. I helped them implement this change. But here is where I come back to your argument. I still find myself now pulling out a piece of paper to work chem problems or to write notes and this is a reality check. Who am I to come into a huge company bugging engineers to stop wasting paper when I do the same thing?
<br><br>

But what I think is important to remember is that while it would be ideal if we could stop all the waste in the world, the simple fact is that you have to start somewhere. And going back to your example of eating, even if you were to cut down your meat eating by a half or a third or a quarter even, you are starting to help make a difference, you’re also not trying to simply go cold on all meat products. Educating people on where to start with their consumption issues is important, but doing what you can and always trying to be better is extremely important.
<br><br>

I completely agree with this statement of "moral laziness"  and I too can see it in my own lifestyle. I am aware that consuming meat so regularly and transportation by car is harmful to the environment but I am not willing to give it up.  The reality is that there are plentiful options to a more climate-friendly lifestyle but convenience drives me to not partake. I believe another reason why people are not changing is that the bulk of the population is not either. Thus, driving the attitude that if others are not doing it, then why should I? If no one is changing either, it must not be that bad right? But adding up the total emissions of everyone with this same attitude is what is driving the emissions in this country to be so high.

<br><hr>
I experience the same moral laziness. I have learned in various contexts the benefits of becoming vegetarian or avoiding eating meat. I watched Food, Inc. in my AP Environmental Science class, which showed how corrupt and disgusting food production could be. I learned about the ethics of eating meat in my Philosophy 1 class and argued for the ethical treatment of animals. Now, I’m once again learning about the benefits of foregoing a meat diet for the sake of the climate. Each one of these situations would theoretically push me towards becoming vegan or vegetarian, but in reality, I have not. I have thought about it, but it is just so much easier to continue eating meat. Even with the easy access to vegetarian options in UCSB’s dining commons and the implementation of Green Mondays, I still choose to grab a chicken taco or go to a dining common that is not running a Green Monday.
<br><br>
These fires in our local area are the beginning of a visible climate change. I believe people, including Santa Barbara and Ventura County citizens, will start making bigger changes, like their diets, when these visible changes are more prominent. However, it will likely be too little too late by then. We need to start making big changes as soon as possible. But how do we make change when we cannot even give up a burger?

<br><hr>

Your comment is very relatable to me because I also feel the same way with moral laziness. I feel that people today do not think that climate change is a big deal and will not happen in our generations. I liked how you explain we cannot visibly see the mistakes of climate change. When we live our lights on, we don't see the greenhouse gas go in the air. When I eat a burger, I won't see the methane that goes in the air. For that reason, I too am morally lazy. I really feel like I don't care because I feel that I am not affected by any of this climate change. I say that I care for this earth but I am not doing anything to improve it. I am to busy focusing on my future of school and being with friends instead of caring for this earth that gives me happiness. The beauty of the earth is now deteriorating unless we all change our ways from being morally lazy and I too will have to overcome this barrier.

<br><hr>

Dispute the fact that I agree with your point, reading it was very frustrating. We are aware of climate change's effects, we have the technology, knowledge, and innovation to stop it; what's holding us back? Why can't we seem to move forward with any progress against the climate crisis? 
<br><br>

I feel stuck, trapped in a state where I desperately want to move and change and scream and take immediate action but I'm stuck, stuck by corporations, by slow moving government, by climate deniers, by simple unintrest, by boomers, who all seem to hold all the power over us and our decisions. 
<br><br>

I want to create the change, which is why, immediately after watching a documentary on not eating meat, I went vegetarian. When I learning about the environmental and social impacts of fast fashion I started shopping at secondhand stores and looking into the ethicality of companies before I shop there. When I read about the amount of problems electronic production created, I decided t by my MacBook refurbished. 
<br><br>

I want to create a change, I don't want to look back at this time and tell my children that I'm apart of the problem. I refuse to let myself be apart of the problem, especially if I know exactly what is causing the problem. 
<br><br>

I understand that there are m major consequences to leading a typical American life. If we truly want change, lets first begin to look at our own carbon footprint, and see which toes we can cut off. Taking this class without taking action (no matter how small) seems pointless, let's hold ourselves responsible for the tons of carbon we allow to be released into the atmosphere every year.
<br><hr>
To me, the sentence "it is easier to just not" is what really spoke out about humanity as a whole. In today's very dynamic society, a lot of people are working jobs and involved in personal activities. To people with such busy lifestyles, making individualistic changes on a global issue that hasn't yet impacted them personally seems unlikely. I am very glad that Scott Wilson, in his article "2ºC: Beyond the limit", mentions how global industrialization is affecting people over at Santa Barbara because it demonstrates that the consequences of global warming have already arrived at our doorstep. Santa Barbara and Ventura have already crossed the 2-degree threshold that the article talks about. With temperatures of 2.3 and 2.6 degrees Celsius above existing temperatures in pre-industrial times, Santa Barbara and Ventura county have already been a hefty victim of climate change and I remember seeing it first hand.
<br><br>


Towards the end of 2019 near Thanksgiving as I'm sure all of you can remember, there was a fire that occurred on the hills overlooking UCSB's campus. Many residents were forced to evacuate their homes in a frenzy and firemen were working around the clock to contain the fire. Although the damage the fire caused was laughable compared to other wildfires that have occurred around the world and in other regions in California, I believe this incident should be treated as a wake-up call to all Santa Barbara and Ventura citizens. Since when do wildfires occur in late November? The temperature increase due to global carbon dioxide emissions has increased the fire-season to pretty much all year-round. All of this because we have crossed the threshold that Scott Wilson warns us about in his article.
<br><br>


Furthermore, even though seeing the direct effects of global warming in our area is terrifying enough, the fact that global warming is also affecting the harvesting of crops is even scarier. In simple economics, the global population is still constantly rising. With climate change, our food supplies and harvests are dropping as our crops cannot handle the hotter, drier climate. As the article mentions, people such as Jay Ruskey are forced to stop planting crops such as avocado which requires a lot of water. Instead, Ruskey turns to alternative fruits such as dragonfruit which resists hotter climates. This shortage of food and population increase suggests that global demand for food will rise while actual harvesting will slowly diminish, increasing the prices of fresh produce. Poverty will be higher than ever as people struggle to keep up with the increasing prices of fruits and vegetables in the market, especially in poor countries.
<br><br>


After seeing the direct and indirect consequences of excessive greenhouse gas emissions in the area I live in, I am even more convinced that we have to act now. Wildfires and the harvesting of crops are issues that will continue to deteriorate if we do not find a way to get global emissions under control. But unfortunately, I agree with what Evan said, on an individualistic level, it's hard for people to feel like they are contributing anything toward resolving the issue alone. We also do not see the harm we are doing to the farmers and their crops. On top of that, the harm we contribute individually is so insignificant compared to everyone worldwide that it does not feel like we have any control over the situation. At this point, creating or joining organizations and collectives seems to be the only way to motivate society to act. I strongly believe a movement is needed to spark change, nothing will happen if the changes to be made remain individualistic because everyone can't be bothered with an issue that requires the participation of so many people in the first place.

<br><hr>

Considering I also relate to your situation, I think a self-diagnosis of "moral laziness" is in order on my behalf. I always knew that the environment was important and that it was in danger of climate change, but to be honest, my ignorance got the better of me and I never was truly aware of the severity of this issue until enrolling in the English 22-23 series. I'm thankful for what I've learned so far in understanding the situation at hand just in general, but I also hope to find a way to better implement that environmental consciousness. As you mentioned, it's one thing to talk and another to actually put your foot down and get to work, just as you, me, and even the Santa Barbara County officials seem to struggle with. While many of the topics discussed in lecture about the impacts of climate change on the planet are global, hence obviously encompassing our own communities, it's really a punch to the face when that globalization is brought to scale with the impacts just outside our homes. Knowing exactly how deeply in danger California truly is makes my stomach lurch with fear. I was already concerned, of course, but hitting so close to where we are currently with the real life consequences is something I cannot deny. I like to consider myself and environmentalist, but as your last statement goes, I hope I can become better at implementing these lifestyle changes and protecting our planet, our state, our beaches, et cetera from a truly terrible fate.

<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, however it makes me wonder what the solution is to catalyzing action taken to combat climate change in the Santa Barbara area. Reading this article hits so close to home because it actually is our home. I know personally this article makes me want to change my diet and change my everyday life, but I agree with your idea that I have laziness around changing my everyday life. Growing up, I didn’t realize 1. How bad climate change actually was and 2. That I could help make a difference for the planet, so I just continued on my day to day life not changing anything that could help the planet. However, reading this article and seeing how artificial the help that is talked about in the Santa Barbara county makes me actually want to change. The lobbyists and congressmen not doing their job to help their area and help please their constituents is terrifying because they have big voices that could make a change in our area. 
<br><br>
 I have searched for the solution on how to inform people on the climate crisis and how to encourage people to make changes, but I just can't pinpoint what it is. It makes me wonder that as much as its advertised and talked about, the only thing that will really make a difference is when people see it first hand how bad it is and how it is actually affecting their home. I think that this article encourages more people in the Santa Barbara area to make a change because it is scary seeing the effects on the place we call home.
<br><hr>
The way that you tackled this idea is really interesting. Rather than calling people out for not acting, you have explained why, and I think you did so very well. 'Moral laziness' is no doubt a major cause of why climate change is not only happening, but excelling. I think a major issue is that, in America, our lifestyles aren't even remotely scaling back, but simply growing. We want bigger cars, houses, everything. As technology advances, we are quickly adapting and getting used to the comforts that this new world is providing. The more comfortable we get, the stronger the 'moral laziness' will be. And yes, the elected officials are working with oil companies, as well as other companies that are majorly contributing to greenhouse gas emission, and that's obviously not going to help anything. But we already knew that the government was corrupt, and we're at a point where we clearly can't count on them to make changes. The younger generation is the one that's going to have to see these effects firsthand, as the 'invisible force' is becoming less and less invisible. What the older generation can't seem to grasp is how bad they've made it for us, as a lot of them still don't believe in the cause whatsoever. And the idea that 'moral laziness' is caused by the fact that people don't believe their singular actions can make a difference is a very true argument, yet I believe it is almost completely countered by the work of Greta Thunberg. She's 17 years old and not from America, yet we all know her name, and what she's working for. She has singlehandedly started a fire in the stomachs of millions of people who demand change. Though 'moral laziness' is a disease that we all succumb to in one way or another, in the sense of the climate crisis, I believe it can be overcome. I'm saying this like you, as someone who can definitely make more personal changes to benefit climate change, but I'm almost willing to try anything at this point.
<br><hr>

I think this comment is so interesting, and the fact that it has so many replies from people who feel the same. I went vegan almost five years ago, and many people tell me they admire me but they just can’t do it themselves. But at the same time, many of my friends have stopped eating meat after we talked about the impact of meat on the planet. Even my family, after several years, has now switched to a primarily plant-based diet and call me with reviews of new meat alternatives or news of new vegan products. The amazing thing is that after completely switching to a plant-based diet, you get to see what a difference just one person can really make. I used to have to eat at home before going out with my friends because I knew there wouldn’t be plant-based options wherever we were going. Now, just a couple years later, I don’t have to worry, because almost every restaurant is ready to accommodate a vegan diet. I can even go to Carls Jr. and order a Beyond Burger if I want. And often, just my presence encourages others to try out a vegan meal or ask me about my diet. I think this is awesome, because I definitely try not to push the vegan agenda on anybody, but a lot of people want to talk about it without me bringing it up!
<br><br>

At the same time, I definitely understand the difficulty of making that switch. Sure, eating vegan is a habit for me now, but it’s hard living in a world that makes the environmentally disastrous option so easy and convenient while making it so difficult for us to live a life that doesn’t impact the environment. It’s hard to stop using fossil fuels, it’s hard to stop using plastic, it’s hard to stop eating meat or using animal products. We all fall victim to "moral laziness" and justify things to make our lives easier. But I think once we overcome that initial barrier and switch, it also makes us feel good that we’re finally doing something.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with this statement about the moral laziness and now understood why we don’t do any action even through we learned and agreed with the idea about the emergency situation of climate changes. This idea, in some extent, is same with the idea of comfort zone: we clearly know the we are wrong to stay in current situation and we need to get rid of it and do something to change, but we don’t and stay in the way that makes us comfortable and safe. We know that we need to do something to be more environmentally friendly and stop destroying the earth that is the only place that we can live in, but we just know it and that’s it.

<br><hr>
I agree with the idea of moral laziness affecting the majority of people, I'm included in that group as well. It's extremely difficult to change our ways even though we know fully how badly our lifestyles affect other things like the environment. I've also tried a vegetarian diet, verging on vegan diet, but it is incredibly hard for me to fully commit to it because of outside and internal factors. As much as I want to become more environmentally conscious, I'm heavily affected by this "moral laziness." Coming from a So-Cal native, I've seen the effects of climate change heavily in our part of California. In 2016, I saw both the Pilot Fire and the Bluecut Fire ravage through the Cajon Pass in San Bernardino County. The Pilot Fire had burned nearly 8,000 acres before it was fully contained. If that wasn't enough on its own, only hours later the Bluecut Fire began and ended up burning over 36,000 acres. The ash in the sky during these times caused air pollution problems that caused respiratory health problems for not only me but the majority of the people who lived in my area at the time. To say that we don't see the harm we're doing or that it seems off in the distance, isn't entirely truthful. However, because these disasters are happening more and more frequently, I feel that we've become semi numb to the notion of climate change because we're becoming used to this being the new norm. Many will just say "oh it's just California being California." When in reality we know the cause of the rapidly increasing amounts of fires occurring in our state. The climate is changing in front of our eyes, and we know it, but we still have this huge barrier stopping us from making any real changes. I'm entirely guilty of this as well, and I plan on continuing my journey to becoming a part of the solution and leaving behind my problematic ways in an attempt to stop being a part of the problem.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your response and I could not have said it better. After learning all the material from eng 22 and eng 23, I kept wondering exactly what was stopping us from acting, and while I had a general idea, the phrase “moral laziness” describes it perfectly. I too have previously tried going vegetarian but stopped because of the sheer amount of inconveniences and obstacles that it had caused me. I think, like you said, it is because climate change is seen as some abstract, invisible force. Everyone always tells themselves, “oh eating this hamburger won’t hurt anyone,” or “buying this shirt won’t do any harm,” but these excuses build up and these small, seemingly insignificant actions produce catastrophic consequences. 
<br><br>

People often have herd mentality, if they see others doing something they will often follow them. It takes, like you said, an authority to guide them into doing something alternative. Ken is right in his lecture videos in saying that our generation must take charge of the world now. Creating new leaders, like Greta Thunberg, is the only way that we will be able to unify and fight against climate change as collectively. 
<br><br>

I still struggle with fighting off urges to just eat that hamburger or buy that cute shirt on sale, but as I learn more and more about the climate crisis through this course, I hope some of these impulses will be mitigated.
<br><hr>
I really like/agree with the idea of "moral laziness" that you brought up. I remember being in my AP Environmental Science class as well and watching a movie about climate change that must have been made 10 years ago saying how little time we have left if our actions continue. I felt absolutely helpless and I was unable to think about how I can make a difference as an individual. But I think humans have this self-destructive ability to easily forget things. We push it things to the side and decide to go on with our daily lives. When are we going to spot thinking our actions are meaningless and realize that we need collective action? It blows my mind that I sit in lecture for 50 minutes 3 days a week and listen to Ken basically tell us we have no time left, we are near the "tipping point", but then at 2:50 I pack up my bag and don't think about climate change until the next class or until I start that week's homework. So what does this even say about me? It sounds pretty sad because I consider myself someone who is more concerned with climate change than most other people. A lot of people I talk to would rather not think about it whatsoever, let alone consider changing their diet although they know the consequences of eating meat. 
<br><br>


Another thing to acknowledge from the article is that Santa Barbara is supposed to be known for their climate activism but it was noted that they are "caring more about about how it looks than how it lives". Some cities refuse to have wind turbines or other types of renewable energy because of how it negatively affects the feel/scenery of the town. One of the quotes that I also found interesting from this article was, "We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something”. "Moral laziness" and the climate crisis is like a college student procrastinating their 10 page paper until the night before it's due.

<br><hr>

I agree because I've really considered changing my diet but I know it'll be very difficult and I don't think I could push myself to go through with it. I know that choice is the reason we're in this mess as a lot of people could relate. As well as the topic of free parking. As a driver it's a real nuisance when you have to pay for parking when in reality we're doing more damage to the earth driving than parking fees is doing to our bank account.
<br><hr>
I agree with this comment thoroughly and honestly relate to this concept of “moral laziness.” I see the frightening headlines as I scroll on Twitter, yet I find myself sticking to what I have always done as an average every day person. I still continue to eat my meats and ride the bus and drive my car when I am at home equipped with one. While I do not want to justify my own wrongs and my lack of making the changes that I could make, I still think it is the responsibility of those in governmental power to make the changes in legislation and in enforcement. They could be lured by money, but in their position, they represent hundreds to thousands to millions of people and the endless consequences inflicted upon our planet. Corporations that continue their poor habits of releasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere for profit lead the mass to believe that if these bigger companies won’t get accounted for, then there is no point in making changes in our lives. After all, an individual’s impact can end up overshadowed from a corporation’s contribution. An individual could find themselves trying to make progress, avoiding a “beautiful cheeseburger” for a meal and considering going vegan, only to see factories and their smoke polluting the earth, feeling their motivation and inspiration deflate.
<br><br>

If a change is going to happen, it has to be collective. Fossil-fuel companies show so much disregard. They need to take action, since their contribution is so immense. And while yes, one individual’s impact seems so little, individuals make up a corporation. If a whole group makes changes, it can be equivalent to a company. If 1000 people made the one choice to eat little to no meat or to bike that day, that’s a single person’s contribution x 1000. Seems like a larger effect now, right? I hope you get my conclusion that it takes everyone. So all parties, all people, need to move forward and turn to being more conscious of our common home. In all honesty, if we don’t, I fear that the force that will lead us to care will be when it’s too late, when we have no choice. No choice of using less water because we lost access to it. No choice of driving less because roads are on fire. No choice of going vegan because there is no food supply left. I really hope this is not the outcome for us.
<br><hr>
I think this is exactly why individual actions cannot stop climate change, while collective action can. We are all, personally, lazy: yet regulation works well. Higher taxation, restrictions on use, etc. all can genuinely change human behavior for better or worse. We're not using plastic bags anymore because, well, we literally can't without putting in a lot of effort to do so. In the same way, raising the price of gas, making single-use plastics illegal, etc. can shift our preferences and what we consume, produce, and do. 

<br><br>

Many people say that climate change is a problem of individual problems, but it really isn't. Or, well, it is... but we can't stop it through those same individual actions. A thousand individual people going vegan won't stop the animal agriculture industry, but laws certainly can.
<br><hr>
I find what you are saying to be very true and particularly insightful. I, too, find myself in a constant battle between doing what is convenient and doing what I know is best in light of the climate crisis. I identify my diet as "flexitarian" meaning that I still eat animal products on the occasion, but I mainly eat vegan. I have often asked myself why it is so difficult for me to even consider committing to becoming completely vegan. I think that moral laziness is part of it, I think that I find myself almost envious of people who live their lives care-free in terms of the climate crisis as well. I also think that I justify my little non-eco-friendly splurges as a treat, or that if I only do it every once in a while that I'm not actually adding to the climate crisis in the ways that other people are. I think that Santa Barbara as a city or county is exemplifying these reasonings too. As an already fairly eco-friendly area, reducing tourism for a reduction in CO2 emissions from cars might seem steep for officials. However, not taking this step is cowardly and hypocritical.
<br><br>
Santa Barbara's lack of action when it counts is a terrible example for other places. I agree with a quote in the article in which the county supervisor called the people of Santa Barbara "environmental poseurs". It is terrible to see that the people who live here and claim to be environmentalists, would back out of taking steps to produce change because of a possible loss of tourism. It is reminiscent, but not a complete parallel to white feminism; saying that you care about an issue, maybe being a bit educated about it, but not taking everything into consideration. Not taking your own negligence into consideration, ignoring intersectionality, ignoring the fact that women of color have it much worse, ignoring that trans women are women that are brutally murdered terribly frequently, but claiming to be fighting for women (all women). In reality, it is more like you want to look woke but you aren't willing to sacrifice anything for what you believe in, you aren't willing to look at your part in the issue, you aren't willing to actually do the work that will produce change.
<br><br>
I guess that what I am saying is, we all must fight the urge to carry on in our daily lives like a fake woke white lady would, ok? (if you're a white girl and you're reading this, I am a white girl too. If you're mad, get over it)


<br><hr>

I strongly agree with your take on what you describe as "moral laziness" and the "invisible force. I feel that as a society the circumstances we are placed in often lead us to become blind to the most drastic of problems and have a sense of ignorance to the changes that are happening before our eyes. Take UCSB students for example, we live in paradise. We are blocks away from the beach, we have mountains soaring behind us, and - for the most part - the weather is always nice. There is nothing that screams climate change in our city, so there is no reason for us to partake in trying to revert and fix something that is being made to seem so drastic and dramatic. Until there is. While our city, beaches, and mountainsides are so unbelievably breathtaking, we forget that our beaches are filled with tar that still seeps into the sands from a spill that happened in 1969. Instead of raising questions or issues on this matter, we find the nearest hack to help us get rid of the stains on our feet. Our mountains - some lined with grapevines - make the idea of land combining so abruptly with the sea seem unreal. Yet, we don't raise questions about the alarming proximity of fires and how easier they are becoming to start. We get angry at rush hour traffic but never stop to consider if there are other modes of transportation that would clear up the streets and be more beneficial to the environment. We live life fast. Our capitalist society has left us on the demand to go higher - in search for more. We have no time to worry about the consequences of the action we take, because if the consequences aren't alarmingly visible,  we shouldn't have to. You're right, we have all systematically fallen guilty to these barriers, but the question now becomes, what will it take for us to wake up and want to change for the better?

<br><hr>
Moral laziness is a product of humans lifestyle choices that have been developed over generations before us. Lifestyle changes are difficult to go about, especially when people don't feel motivated to make a difference. Moral laziness is an issue that can only be solved by making  issues easier to tackle. If not taking a car was easier than taking a car,  everyone would be biking or walking instead of driving. If we cannot engineer our way out of these issues, what can we do? First of all we should begin to alter lifestyle changes by enforcing things in moderation. A great example can be seen at our own UCSB dinning commons. Occasionally the dinning commons will serve a burger called the Applegate burger. This hamburger is a blend of beef and mushroom and often times preferred as opposed to a beef hamburger. The Applegate demonstrates how we can slowly shift our lifestyle habits into something more sustainable.

<br><br>

I agree completely that moral laziness is humanities issue in regards to making changes that will benefit the Earth. However, combating this issue is very difficult and, if not done effectively, won't make a significant difference in the long run.
<br><hr>
While I agree that most people struggle with changing their habits and routine as a result of what you refer to as “moral laziness”, I also think this attitude is primarily driven by our culture. Our lives are bombarded by advertisements for fast food and fast fashion both of which you acknowledge as being unsustainable however growing up accustomed to this culture is part of the reason many people find it so difficult to make changes in their life. Moreover our culture has made it irresistibly convenient to live an  unsustainable life. That new jacket it just a click away online and that burger you're craving maybe just a 5 minute drive away.  I think if things aren't so readily available to people, they seldom go out of their way to obtain them. This again circles back to the idea of moral laziness in the sense that if our culture shifted in a way to promote sustainable living and provided more options to live in this way, people would be more willing to make changes since they have now become available at their convenience. 
 <br><br>
Whats even more interesting though is that you may argue if people are presented with a beef based burger over a plant based burger at the same convenience, most people will still choose a beef burger but this too is a result of a cultural disconnect. Too many people will immediately write off a plant based alternative before ever having tried it, assuming a plant based alternative will always be inferior. It is this very attitude however that the Beyond Meat company is seeking to shift by providing an alternative that people see as equally satisfying. Once this can be done, I think this could eliminate any cause for "moral laziness" because alternatives would be offered at equal convenience and satisfaction.
<br><br>
 As far as the article goes, I find it troubling that the nearby Ventura has seen some of the most dramatic spikes in temperature and think the erosion taking place on Del Playa is of equal concern. Seeing the effects of climate change in real time is not only surreal but unsettling considering these changes will become a new normal. While I think Santa Barbara has been a leader of the environmentalists movement in the past, more changes simply need to be made to remain a leader in this fight.
<br><hr>
I can't agree no more to your perspective because I also experience the same issue as you may call it the "moral laziness." My high school teacher in the AP environmental science class introduces me to the anthropocentric world and the anthropogenic climate crisis, which he also tries so hard to make us believe that a biocentric standpoint should be held and people should live peacefully and consider for the planet as it is so fragile. After graduating from his course, I think that I am closer to the planet in which I know about what causes damage to it and what will prevent bad things from happening again. And accidentally, I say to myself that I am an environmental person that I care about nature and I persuade my friends to join me in keeping our planet safe and beautiful. Ironically, what comes out from my mouth doesn't come to action. I still eat whatever I want and I always dream of having gasoline and the exotic car, which especially consumes much more gas than other vehicles. I am just being "moral laziness." 

<br><br>

But as I learn from this article that the world is changing so rapidly in which farmers in southern California start to change what they plant for centuries due to water shortage and high temperature, I contemplate and I wonder what I can do to offer some help. I just don't want to read a book saying that farmers in southern California are planting dragon fruits in my 30s when I read a similar book in my high school that says that grapes and avocado are the specialties in southern California because of the Mediterranean climate pattern. I can't imagine how things change so rapidly and we are stuck at making any changes. Let's be more "morally active" and consider for the planet but not be "moral laziness."
<br><hr>
I really like that you addressed "moral laziness", a characteristic that everyone is guilty of. You touched on the factor of convenience and how much it matters to people and I thought this was very insightful. People often have to weigh the benefits of what they believe in and while people can protest against climate change, are these same people willing to give up meat or eradicate non-reusable packaging? Your comment was very thought provoking and influenced mine!

<br><hr>

I would like to point out the distinction you made between bad people, and people who are only inflicted with "moral laziness". I see the point you make, some choose not to care about the environment, but I don't think everyone who "chooses not to care" is as educated on our current environmental climate as we are. We are being taught a course at a top public university on what we can do to change our environment. I would argue that we are just as guilty as the "bad people," if not more guilty. We know what we can do to change, yet we don't. Is there really any reason to be learning this unless we are going to make changes in our lifestyles? One of the most valuable lessons I've learned in college thus far came from my geological catastrophes class. At the last lecture, my professor put up a slide reading "to know and not to do is not to know." He later explained that if we did not implement changes in our lifestyles, we were just as ignorant as we were before taking the class. So why do I still struggle with the moral laziness that you mentioned?
 <br><br>

I know that the earth is warming at an alarmingly fast rate, and I know the steps that I can take to turn this around. I've made changes in the past, like switching from beef to chicken and buying as little plastic as possible, but I don't feel like that alone makes a difference. It's completely hypocritical of us, given that we have the privilege of being educated, and live in a country where we have access to more environmentally friendly products. I guess the question we have to ask ourselves is how we want to be remembered for future generations. We condemn big oil corporations, yet we are not playing a part in changing what we as individuals can. If it is difficult for us to make small changes, it is even more difficult for a major oil corporation who is making profit off of the exploitation of our planet.
<br><hr>

I totally agree with the idea that one major reason that stoped people from taking action against the climate crisis is that they cannot see clearly how they are making a difference to the world as individuals because their power seems so negligible comparing to the entire world. I cannot directly feel how the global warming is mitigated if I choose to be a vegetarian or if I decide to bike instead of taking a bus to the campus every day. When people cannot see the direct benefit of taking actions, it really hurts their incentive as if things are not getting better anyway. In fact, if we look at this problem from the perspective of game theory, we would know why people rarely take action. The major concern that people have is that even if they act individually to reduce their carbon emission, the climate crisis would still pervade when everyone else is not acting at all. If this happens, then not only is their effort in vain, they would also feel like they are sacrificing the convenience of driving a car or the joy of eating meat with nothing in return. Thus, they prefer not to respond to the climate crisis. Therefore, the asymmetry of information is undermining people’s determination to take action. This situation would continue unless everyone knows that there are people out there who are contributing the same to fighting against the climate change and their effort would make a difference. That is, in my opinion, the most urgent thing to do. Then, we can finally devote ourselves to figuring out specific strategies rather than worrying that our effort won’t pay off.

I would like to begin this response by stating that I wholeheartedly agree with everything written above.  I feel as though everyone could provide a personal anecdote as to how “moral laziness” has affected their ability to act on the causes that they claim to be so important to them. For me, this comes from a similar struggle to switch to an entirely plant-based diet.  This has actually become even harder of a task for me since switching to vegetarianism eight years ago as I can use this fact as almost a pat in the back for moving in the right direction, instead of recognizing it as what it is, just not enough.  
 <br><br>
 Next, I find it interesting how both the article and the above comment recognized Santa Barbara as placing a high value on goals of averting climate change. I feel as though this “moral high ground” that is so easily held by more liberal places and states that widely recognize climate change as an issue is similar to the feeling that I have gained by holding a vegetarian diet.  It is easy to look at others and claim moral superiority when living in a place where this problem is at least recognized. But just believing is not enough, we need to turn this passion into action and lead others not by looking down on them but via example. 
 <br><br>
Finally, I would like to agree with the issues that are laid out that lead to this inaction and then ponder some possible actions that we in Santa Barbara can take.  For big, abstract problems as the three outlined in the above comment, big creative solutions are necessary. It seems as though “spreading the word” about climate change and what one can do to decrease their emissions is the most important step to solving all three of the leading problems to inaction. For this reason, I would like to commend Ken Hiltner for creating this class to do just that, and for allowing access to the material all over the world.  I hope that through this class, Santa Barbara especially can be changed for the better one student at a time.
<br><hr>
I liked your comment very much because I could relate to it, 3 years ago while I was in high school my best friends decided to become vegetarian in part because she travelled a lot and she tried to reduce her carbon footprint in other parts of her lifestyle. I listened to her almost every day giving us lectures about the ongoing climate crisis as well as animal cruelty and health benefits. I started to think, just like you explained very well “moral laziness”, it’s true, most people do not change their lifestyle simply because it is easier not to. People don’t generally tend to change unless they see vivid consequences of their actions. For example, I would bet many more people would be vegetarian or vegan if they had to kill an animal to be able to eat a burger rather than order it in a fast food restaurant while enjoying fries with their friends. I love this analogy you used for congress men to choose not to change current laws while they need money for other things including their own personal needs. 
 <br><br>
The problem with the climate crisis, just like with people’s diet is that it seems distant. I would argue that most people are very much aware of at least a few consequences of climate change, but they don’t think about this every time they pay for gas to drive to work rather than waking up 30 minutes earlier to take the bus. They might not think this sacrifice to their sleep schedule is worth it, because of the little impact it would have. But they don’t think about this because they don’t have to leave their homes due to rising sea levels, or their crops didn’t die from a record drought. People don’t think about making lifestyle sacrifices based on an article or documentary unless it has a profound effect on their daily lives, but by that time it might be too late.
<br><hr>

Your comment definitely hit close to home because I too preach an extent of environmental awareness, yet when I look at my own habits they are nowhere near the level of environmental consciousness that I idealize. I have also gone through the phases of going vegan or vegetarian, but then after a few weeks I fall back into old ways because it doesn’t take any extra effort from me to go ahead and eat that burger rather than going to find a friendlier option. It is so easy (yet dangerous) to think that my decision to eat meat or dairy won’t affect the greater scheme of things because so many other people around me are doing it, but there is a guilt that I personally feel every time I continue to do so. Especially at an institution like UCSB, where we are prided on being one of the top green schools in the nation, it is easy to believe that I am contributing an environmental movement because I happen to be in Santa Barbara, or because I happen to be at this particularly green school. But what am I doing to benefit the movement? What great steps have I done to lessen my carbon footprint? It is sad to say that I have fallen into the habits of a lazy consumer although I have the opportunities to study the climate crisis and I have every opportunity to become more green right before me. 
 <br><br>
Similarly, I do hope that this class can help me overcome these personal barriers that feed into my selfish consumption. I live in a birthplace for the environmental movement but with further investigation, it is just another community that struggles to do its part; hopefully soon that is no longer the case. It has to start somewhere and I feel a moral obligation to start with myself.
<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that as a society we do struggle to take into thought that consequences in the future because we do not want to give up lifestyle choices such as being able to eat meat. It is interesting that you pointed out the fact that since climate change is a " invisible" force people do not take it as a priority because it is not directly affected them yet, at least not the majority of people. There are visible factors of climate change like fires and stronger tsunamis, but since people do not really consider climate crisis having to do with that they do not worry about it. I think most of the time when people think of the climate crisis they think about the ice caps melting, something  that is far from affecting their daily lives sat the moment.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment, and I'm ashamed to admit it. I, too, have promised myself that I would go vegan too but I always break this promise because it takes to much work and effort. It's heartbreaking to think that our government is doing the same thing when offered mass amounts of money. It's shameful that they can't think of future generations over money, but at the same time, I am the one eating bacon breakfast sandwiches from starbucks almost everyday. I believe that we are going to continue this behavior until it's too late, which is sad but unfortunately true. Reading the article about SB was particularily saddening- knowing that a city with a reputations as being one of the leading environmentally friendly places is, in reality, doing none of the sort. It's crazy that, even though our state is constantly threatened by fires, our government is still going to install more oil drills in the north, which will eventually contribute to the emissions. I've had firsthand experience with fires, and it's so sad seeing innocent people die because of climate change. Overall, I'm sad. I'm sad that people aren't living up to the promises of new policies, of carbon emission goals, and that the  man in the white house doesn't even believe anything is wrong.
<br><hr>
I feel the same way, and it's an interesting perspective to see from that I couldn't catch upon my initial read of the article. Just like how Santa Barbara is known to be this eco-friendly green land to outsiders, its lack of action to fight against climate change seems rather strange. However, your conviction stands. It really is simply "moral laziness." Why is it that we as citizens of this world can't seem to shake off the idea that it is "too hard" to help make a change. I act the same way as well. Like many others, it just does not feel right for me to complain about an issue that I didn't even try to change. I can't be talking about how much carbon emission these urban dwellers are putting out when I'm driving everywhere I go, no matter how close it is to me. It really isn't easy considering our entire society has been developed on this idea that "easier is better." Every day, our lives are further simplified by the methods and technology that is developed around us, and all of them with the goal to simplify our lives. It's essentially engraved in our own ways to believe that. However, it's toxic to keep that same mindset in all aspects of our lives, such as believing that it's easier that your singular vote won't do much so it's better for you to not waste time and not vote at all. Why don't we bike or walk to our local grocery store to save gas, money, and decrease our carbon footprint? Because it's easier to drive. We take these simplifying developments in our society for granted without taking into account the harm that it puts out on others and the climate. It's a selfish way of thinking.
<br><hr>
Like everyone else, I have been guilty of making environmentally damaging choices. However, it is difficult to feel motivated to make a change when money-hungry fossil fuel companies do not take the initiative. As pessimistic as it seems, our actions as individuals make very little progress in our battle with climate change. I do not mean this to free myself of guilt or undermine the severity of the issue. For example, I myself have given up meat and dairy, and I encourage others to do so as well. However, let's consider the many developing countries of the world who also heavily depend on meat. It is these exact countries that have contributed virtually nothing to climate change compared to the United States. I completely agree with having some self-awareness and acknowledging our faults, but the blame lies undoubtedly with these big exploitative companies, not with innocent families trying to get by. 
 <br><br>

Again, although pretty negative, I also believe there is insignificant power in individuals but rather power in an organization. It will take humans completely flipping their way of life by the masses to start making a change. There are endless angles to the climate crisis, and while they are all of great importance, we must address the root of the problem. There is no question that everyone, in some way has contributed to climate change. It is now a matter of who is contributing the most and how harmful it is, which unfortunately points to powerful multi-billion dollar companies. I know It is easy to feel helpless as a consumer with little power. What we can do, however, is to organize and make our demands heard. There is power in boycotting, protesting, and most importantly, as Ken said last quarter, voting.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you are saying 100% it is insane to me that people still have the audacity to deny the science of climate change even after all the studies, and all the physical signs around us.  I have actually gone through the same feeling with meat I know how bad it is for the planet but I continue to indulge in burgers and steak and so forth.  I have gotten better in terms of meat as I have tried to stay off most red meats and keep myself to mostly chicken as eating that is much more climate-friendly than cows.  And yes you are right about the moral laziness of everyone.  I almost wish the effects of climate change would be more direct which sounds terrible but at least then everyone would realize there is a problem and come together to stop it.  By the time we start seeing side effects that will make everyone listen and want to make a change, it will be too late.
<br><hr>
This comment is probably very relatable to most people in the class, including myself. I have learned a lot about the benefits of going vegan or at least cutting back meat consumption drastically, yet I cannot bring myself to stick with it for long periods of time. I feel as if I am not really doing my part. I am from Sacramento and for many years we have been in a drought and cannot water lawns or wash cars for most days of the week. My family and I abide by this rule, so we understand that the climate is changing, but it is so difficult to put words into action.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you said regarding “moral laziness.” As optimistic as I try to be, I’m always reminded that unfortunately people (all of us) don’t tend to do the right thing “just because.” Since taking English 22 last quarter, I’ve tried my best to make more environmentally conscious choices, as well as inform friends and family about what I learn. I’m beyond thankful for taking the course last quarter because it opened my eyes to the alarming truth we are currently living in. I want to believe together we can all make a difference, but so many of us have the mentality that we, as an individual, are powerless. I recently saw a post saying that the DFA reported a “$1.1 Billion drop in dairy sales in 2018,” clearly demonstrating that we can indeed make a difference. 
 <br><br>
“We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something,” said Edward France, the former executive director of the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition. This statement really stood out to me because it explains why so many of us refuse to take action, even though we’re aware of the damage our actions have caused, and the even greater damage our inaction will lead to. I remember a presentation we had last quarter about steps we could take as a community to become a carbon neutral city. We were given the opportunity to take some type of course to become like a mentor for those who lived around us, and though part of me wanted to do it, I said to myself “others will do it,” which brings me back to “moral laziness.” 
 <br><br>
I do believe that big companies, congressmen, and those who hold power should be held accountable for the environmental damage they’ve caused, and continue to cause, but so should we. Unfortunately, the best incentive is money, and so long as people keep profiting from fossil fuels, the meat and dairy, and fashion industry I don’t believe we’ll make meaningful progress in our fight against climate change. We have to challenge our “moral laziness” because ultimately it comes down to the wellbeing of the planet and everything in it. You said people aren’t necessarily “bad” for exhibiting “moral laziness,” which I definitely agree with, but it’s necessary to understand that if nothing good can come from our so-called “moral laziness,” we have to change our thinking and our actions.
<br><hr>
I agree almost wholeheartedly. I love animals, I know eating animals has a great impact on the environment, and I know that every time I purchase a meat product I am supporting the slaughter of creature I love and contributing to pollution. I, like you, am unfortunately morally lazy on this point, and I cannot excuse my actions. My only problem here is that I think that those in power who are willing to accept checks from big industries to ignore climate change in support of pollution are perhaps not just “morally lazy”. There is a greater effect in supporting renewable energy and disowning fossil fuels than there is in me, singly, refraining from buying a meat/animal product. That cannot be mere moral laziness, politicians and those in power can effect greater change than the average individual. They are not only representing their own interests but everyones’. I do not think one can equate the moral laziness of buying a meat product to supporting a fossil fuel industry and neglecting renewable energy.
<br><hr>
The article describes a horrific scene that is happening right now, the environmental change is accelerating. Most of the changes in Santa barbara is in recent years which never happened before. This is a horrific sign. However, the evidence of the articles is all of the experience but no recent statistic. This really lower the credibility of the article. 
 <br><br>

The last paragraph is classic and the best part of the article. It is really ironic,  the “We’ve got a lot of folks working on those things right now,” and “I hope we have some better answers for you soon.” are the classic reply always come from the person who has the responsibility and ability but no willing to solve the problem. Of course, the officer also faced a lot of the issue which need them to spend time to deal with. The environmental for them is more like a marking thing or propaganda which every officer will claim it, but will not spend their resource to do it. The officers will use their resource to do the thing benefit them most. Most citizens also not care about the environmental issue that much until the issue becomes a disaster. This is an insoluble paradox. The citizen cares more about short-term benefits than the long-term environmental issue. Thus, they will incline to vote for the people who benefit them in the short-term the most. Thus, the elected officials will never actually care about environmental problems.
<br><hr>
I am totally agreeing with what you said. Though what we do for the whole world or the whole environment is still just extremely tiny. Or because of the moral laziness, some of the habits that we have planned for ourselves will finally give up by some of the reasons just like. Though I love the peaceful world. I love my mother nature. I love the wonderful sunshine and seashore in Santa Barbara. And I love to provide an ideal environmentally peaceful place for my offsprings to live. However, if it just prohibits me from eating meat or driving cars. Though I will try to ban myself from those stuff for a week. But at least one week after, I will just definitely order cheeseburgers in In& out and also checking some new cars for myself. Because all of the “environmental alarming” have not threatened so hard on our lives. However, if we were told that keeping has meats will kill the people living to surround us. It will be 100% that I will stop having those proteins. Consequently, we should just have more self-control and have more responsibility to the society that we are living in. By the way, I also hope that this class will convince myself to do something real and helpful to my environment.
<br><hr>
I think "moral laziness" is an amazing term to describe a not-so-amazing thing. I've often thought these same things, but have always failed to come up with a term that describes exactly what I am pondering. For a long long time I was too morally lazy to go vegan, it took pressure from close friends that I trust to change my mind and finally switch from vegetarian to fully plant-based (now, I would never go back!). That being said, I am still too morally lazy to do a lot of other things... for example, I'd rather drive somewhere than ride my bike. I agree with you in that I think it will take until the problem is right in front of our face for us to take action. Us meaning all morally lazy people... or basically everyone living in the U.S. at least. I hope what I learn in this class pressures me to start making more of a difference. One person making a difference might not do much, but if everyone has that mindset, nothing will get done and nothing will ever change!
<br><hr>
I definitely often feel the same way you do regarding moral laziness and how it relates to climate change. I think for this issue specifically it is especially dominant because in order to try and alleviate the climate crisis as individuals, certain lifestyle changes are required that most people don't want to go through, such as not having a car, buying less clothes, using less water, going vegan, etc. Some people may even view this as a sacrifice, which is definitely an indication of a sort of privilege but is also what keeps people from committing to environmentally sound changes in their lives. 
 <br><br>
However, I don't personally agree with your statement regarding that a million dollar check from an environmentally dangerous corporate lobbyist being irresistable to a congressman because I feel that aims to try and justify their unjustifiable actions. I think that as people who make such  important, world-altering decisions, they should not be so easily bought at the expense of the rest of the world and we should not try and justify these situations when they occur. I think these situations rather reveal an underlying, destructive American value that places greed and the accumulation of wealth above all else and often at the expense of others. Given the severity of the issue and the fact that it is literally going to become a matter of life and death, we should expect more from these politicians.
<br><hr>
Firstly, thank you for your honesty and for owning up to what I think you correctly identify as a really common way of thinking. I think that the biggest problem is not that people are evil or want the Earth or its inhabitants to suffer. Most people who engage in environmentally destructive behavior are simply uneducated and/or apathetic. The problem is that the people who make the biggest and most harmful decisions, like the hypothetical Congressmen who chooses money from lobbyists or constituency support over passing a green bill, are often apathetic enough to do so unless something extreme changes their way of thinking. This is why I think we see such perplexing decisions being made when the reality of the situation and the right choice is seemingly so obvious. As the article asked, “If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?” This really struck a cord with me because I remember being a college freshmen here two years ago and being shocked at how environmentally conscious most people seemed. There were so many efforts and campaigns happening around campus to save our oceans and bees and rainforests, compost and recycling bins distributed to encourage people to live more sustainably. Yet, even in city where the Earth Day movement started, the majority of students and locals that I encounter are similarly supportive and happy about these things, but unwilling to make lifestyle changes themselves. I am guilty of this as well. Sure I'll applaud those who volunteer for beach clean-ups, yeah I think my friend who went vegan for environmental and animal cruelty reasons is rad and I believe that's a positive thing to do. But will I commit to doing the same? I don't know the answer to how to make people, including myself, take the step from detached support to engaged living but I would like to find a way to.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment that "moral laziness" is a reason why people aren't doing everything they can to protect our environment. It's crazy to me seeing how people can know that their actions are bad for the earth but will still have no plans on changing their ways. Besides the ones you already mentioned, I think another reason why people don't change their ways is due to convenience. The environmentally friendly action can sometimes be less convenient and more expensive. I personally  believe  that being in a negative spiritual and mental state is a contributor into why people don't care about the earth. If more and more people developed a mindfulness practice, they would startto appreciate the beauty of our earth and thus have an increased desire to protect it.
<br><hr>
I completely relate to your commentary. I’ve had many moments over the last 5 years where I decided to completely quit meat, and did so for 3-4 days. Until I was presented with a barbecue at a friend’s house or a family lunch at a ‘churrascaria’, a Brazilian steakhouse, where I quit my short-lived vegetarianism in exchange for the short lived pleasure of having a juicy cut of meat. I feel like an absolute hypocrite for speaking about climate change when I haven’t done any of the changes that I should have to improve the world, and it really pains me. I’m happy to say that I have reduced my meat consumption; my mom ad stepdad are vegetarians, so I only ate meat when I was at my father’s house, which means I got used to eating meat less often, however not quitting altogether. It’s a small start to the change I have to make, but it’s a step closer to the goal we all need to reach.
<br><hr>
I agree with the concept of moral laziness and personally believe that "morally lazy" people are much more common than inherently malicious or bad people. This compounded by people sticking to habits, not liking change, and simply not caring creates a population of inactive people facing a problem they will likely do nothing about. The effects of climate change are so gradual in how it impacts people's everyday life to a point that it becomes a non-issue in most people's eyes and will not be an effective motivator in changing this population of inactive people to react and become proactive in fighting climate change.
<br><hr>
I feel like this reply entirely represents most people on the planet. So many things are overlooked and carelessly tossed to the side because we'd rather focus on the latest celeb gossip or the newest big clothing line. Somehow we need to show people their direct impact on the planet through these documentaries and films, and give them ideas on how to fix a number of achievable things. 
 <br><br>
In this situation people need to be told that they aren't just going vegan or consuming less for themselves, but for their kids and grandkids years into the future. I wish it were that easy to make people a little more self-less. It is hard to persuade people to do the right thing I know that, but we can't stop trying. So many people aren't ready to give up and the more people we educate and the more people affected by these disasters, things will have to change. People need to see the trauma, emotion, terror, and unfairness that is going on around the world. Ignorance can't last forever when climate change is on your doorstep.
<br><hr>
I actually addressed the same exact issue in my own comment. So many of us run into the common issue of wanting to make a change but putting no effort into actually doing anything. I believe that because we are now able to physically see the potential repercussions of climate change in our own backyard, it gives more incentive to actually try and make a difference. Hlitner's choice in article was extremely wise because it really helped put the problem into perspective. I also want to point out that a potential solution to this problem is to give more incentive to those who want to make a difference but don't have the drive. For example, many people really wanted to help prevent the bushfires in Australia but didn't want to donate, likely due to a lack of immediate benefit. However, when that one instagrammer offered nude photos to whoever donated, hundreds of thousands of dollars were funded. To these people, it was a win/win scenario. Some people just need a little kick to start them off.
<br><hr>
I also agree with your comments and observations about this situation. I can relate with all of the main issues you believe are causing "moral laziness". In the back of my head, even after reading a variety of articles warning about climate change, I think to myself that other people besides me will take action to fight climate change. Because I feel I can't make a significant difference on my own and the climate change movement will be more or less the same without me, I am pushed towards inaction. Even if the worst effects of climate change won't make an appearance in my lifetime, it will still affect my kids and the generations after us. While this class makes me more knowledgeable about the situation of climate change, I still haven't felt a big urge to make changes to my life style, such as a diet change. At what point will we actually be moved to action? Perhaps when we realize that the effects of climate change are too severe for us, it'll be too late for us to combat it.
<br><hr>
I believe we will be forced out of moral laziness by disaster and crisis. Sure, God could come warn you your city would burn unless you stopped eating meat, and that might do the trick... but our cities are burning, and the closer to home they burn, won't this have the same effect? Evan, I think your analysis is pretty clearly relatable and spot-on, stopping the climate crisis is hard, so people don't do it. But seeing the climate crisis up close and personal has caused me to stop eating beef. I think our generation is being forced into action by necessity, moral laziness doesn't hold up well to survival instincts, and sooner or later, I think just about everyone will start to act. My only question is whether that action will be too late.

 <br><br>

I admire that your ending line is a hope for change. I think that's the note the article tried to hit too, farmers are changing the products they grow... because they have to. They are hoping it will be enough. 

 <br><br>

I will make an argument though, and maybe a controversial one, that moral laziness does in fact make you a bad person. I don't mean a cruel and heartless person, just a normal average bad one. Without bringing up an unhelpful and binary example like the trolley problem, I think complacence is a decision, and history tends to look on individuals who were complicit in systems of injustice as not much better than the perceived perpetrators of those systems. 

 <br><br>

I don't think you're a bad person, I think it's easy to see your intentional wrestle with this morality. I would argue the bought congressmen are a leap and a bound away from a single steak dinner in ethics-land, though I appreciate the comparison.

<br><hr>
While it’s true that radically changing your lifestyle in the name of limiting your carbon footprint and “saving” the planet is very difficult for many different reasons, I feel like justifying such inaction by chalking it up to “moral laziness” is, quite frankly, a lazy excuse. It makes us feel better about ourselves because we, as individuals, can do little to make any appreciable difference in the world. Why struggle to become a vegan when the rest of us will continue to eat meat? Why should we try to be more frugal when the privileged will continue to indulge in unnecessary luxuries? We continue to live our consumptive lives in the hope that somebody, somewhere, will come up with a grand plan to fix our planet. Yet, by doing this, we promote the status quo. Big Oil will continue to profit from polluting our atmosphere, freighters and cruise ships will continue to poison our oceans with their bunker fuel, our forests will continue to burn, and we will continue living our lives hoping for change-until something important that keeps the system running breaks. Until that happens, nothing will change-because why should it? How do we even go about moving away from our reliance on fossil fuels-the very thing that made modern society possible? Medicine, transportation, food, our military- it is all, in one way or another, connected to fossil fuels. It seems like a herculean task Yet, if we don’t do something, who will? Certainly not the ones who profit from the industry, nor our government as it currently stands (take, for example, Scott Morrison, prime minister of Australia). In the end, you can either say “it’s not my problem” and hope somebody else takes care of it, or you can take steps, little steps, to change-if not the world, then yourself. Vote for the right people, even if it won’t make a difference. Instead of eating meat 7 days a week, eat meat only 6 days a week. Because if everybody takes these little steps, maybe things will get better. And if they don’t, at least you can say to you did something, rather than nothing.
<br><hr>
I appreciate your clarifying point that the failure to act comes not from apathy or lack of knowledge, but this phenomenon called "moral laziness", which is a particularly sinister type of laziness that corrupts the good will of the human race. I think there is no better proof of the prevalence of this problem than the up-scale communities that the majority of us UC students come from today: as many of us are pretty well-off, at least by global standards, we come from communities of people that are relatively educated and well-informed, whether that be by a formal education or access to online news or both. This means that the middle to upper class communities in which we were born and live the majority of our lives in are filled with people that are well-aware of the impending issue of climate change, and know very well that their gas-guzzling, meat-eating, electricity-sucking lifestyles significantly impact the climate in a negative way. This means that a large number of well-educated people who know full well about the climate crisis are knowingly contributing to it, despite all the knowledge and warnings in the world about the problem, due to this sinister "moral laziness".

 <br><br>

Point is, I think this issue of "moral laziness" is a lot more of an impact than just a few individuals that fail to act. I think this moral laziness is the root (or at least one root of many) of humanity's failure to act in terms of the climate crisis. As such, I don't think the solution to this problem should be to hope on a star that human nature overcomes its base moral laziness every single time it comes up. I think that our solution to this must come from an innate desire to work with human laziness, not against it. This must entail solutions such as making the impacts of individual actions such as gas-guzzling and meat-eating very visible at each point of consumption, whether that be by colored gas trails or warnings at every step of purchase. This must entail solutions that aim at the system of production in order to make the conveniences of everyday life less impactful on the climate, such as making synthetic meat that does not impact the climate to produce, or changing the clothes-making process to have zero impact. I'm well aware these solutions are much, MUCH easier said than done, but I do think there is value in addressing the "moral laziness" of the human race head-on as opposed to hoping that it'll just go away.

<br><hr>
Funnily enough, I just had a conversation with one of my friends about this feeling today. Moral laziness is absolutely a thing, and damn is it hard to break, especially since I grew up in a majority conservative town that didn't place a lot of value into climate change or things to do to combat it. Since being here at UCSB, I've been wanting to make changes to be a lot more environmentally conscious, (i.e. using reusable bags and water bottles consistently, eating less red meat, etc.), yet I still will fall back into the ropes of just eating a burger for lunch at the dining halls because it's the only semi-enticing option to eat within my immediate proximity, or grabbing a plastic bottle of water instead of going to refill my own. I have definitely improved compared to how I was back in my hometown, but I still can't help feel horrified by the general bad habits I have that plague our environment. It's just so easy to be lazy about choices regarding diet, transportation, consumerism, amongst other things, because it's really difficult to place yourself as having a huge impact in the context of climate change, even if you're fully aware of the scale and magnitude of the situation. And similarly to how you ended this comment, I'm really hoping that by being in this class, I push myself to have more conviction towards making more thoughtful and environmentally responsible choices in my daily life.
<br><hr>
I very much enjoyed reading this  response, it was very well thought out and took an interesting approach to the article. I too gravitated not to the local consequences (I generally knew most of the facts about that already) but toward my newfound knowledge that Santa Barbara is not as environmentally friendly as it would like to appear. I think you're right: moral laziness, resulting from a time and space disconnect between the action and the consequences, a nihilistic belief that an individual's actions don't matter, and a scientifically complex and seemingly abstract topic. I, however, do not think we can let moral laziness be our excuse, or our downfall. Moral laziness can only hold back progress for so long, as was the case for all other great and morally necessary changes throughout history. Once we come to terms with the fact that, morally, we ought to be acting a whole lot different than we currently are,  we cannot ignore our inability to make good on our own promises for very long. I like you wonder how we will achieve that shift. I hope it won't be due to the consequences of the climate crisis becoming to severe to ignore, but rather our own education and moral compass prompting us to act in time.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. Born in a country which used to be the factory center of China, I have encountered many long winters with fogs and smokes that severely influence people's everyday lives. We have to wear masks outside to keep ourselves from diseases. People clearly know that our environment is going downward but it's just hard to raise the incentive to make an actual change in daily lives. I hope to help the environment, but when it comes to actual scenarios, I couldn't cut meat out of my life or categorize every trash I am trowing. These laziness rooted in people is probably the biggest reason why we haven't made changes to save our earth.
 <br><br>
The world's economy depends on fossil fuels for so long that the drawbacks are becoming evident. Our economy and politics are all driven by different corporations' benefits. We are building our countries with an expense of our environment and more radically is that most people don't even know about it. The rising sea levels, extinctions of various species, escalating temperatures that will make many places inhabitable...All these outcomes are caused by our daily choices in life. We own our environment an apology and actions are needed immediately before everything is too late.
 <br><br>
The article focus a lot on the forest fires around Santa Barbara which students at UCSB have just experienced last year. It was insane that we can smell the smoke in the hallway of our dorm. It's the first time I felt that climate changes are so drastic and horrifying and they are too close to our lives. It's mind-blowing to me that protecting the environment is more than a slogan or a line on the poster. Its seriousness and urgency shall address everyone's attentions.
<br><hr>
I hadn't heard the term "moral laziness" before, but I think it really accurately describes the dilemma facing a lot of people, myself included. For example, I know that eating healthy and exercising are the proper things to do to take care of myself and sometimes I do them, but other times I simply can't seem to summon the willpower and I find it easier to just do nothing. Similarly, we know that there are many changes we can make in our lives, both big and small, to take care of the earth, and though I sometimes live up to my own moral standards, I very often fall short.
 <br><br>

As an example, after watching Before the Flood last week, I decided that I wanted to start avoiding products with palm oil because of its negative effects on the environment. Although it's only been one week, I've already broken that goal many times. It's frankly ridiculous that I'll still pick up a jar of nutella or a bag of doritos, knowing that they contain palm oil, simply because I want to enjoy the taste for about five minutes, even while knowing full well that it's contributing to the destruction of orangutan habitats. I know that change is possible, however, so I'm continuing to strive to avoid it and hoping that I can maintain such changes in my life so that I won't continue contributing to the climate problem, or at least so that I can reduce the negative impacts that my life has on the environment.

<br><hr>

After reading this article I was perplexed. I also came to some understanding why I and many others didn't take climate change too seriously until we are educated more in depth about it. The reason is pretty simple: we just thought that sea levels may rise (which takes a long time) and polar bears will lose their homes. Some ice will melt. This all felt super distant and irrelevant to me, not nearly enough to drive me to action. It's sad that probably a-lot of our politicians aren't educated in depth on the consequences of climate change. Ofcourse they don't make it a high priority. I was finally convinced after taking two classes that covered climate change, and it solidified me being vegetarian. I have taken the individual action necessary. And this is because I am not alone, but my entire family has committed to this now. I think a community of support has made it easier. I also just pride myself on living up to my values because it is a way I create meaning in my life. How could I say I want to fight against climate change and then stuff beef down my mouth? I wrote a 12 page paper last quarter on the Ethics of Eating Meat, and through my research for it I came to this conclusion: Meat not just inflicts an INSANE amount of suffering on animals, but you are discounting your moral obligations to the poor and to future generations by eating meat (especially beef). One as the climate deteoriates you are hurting future generations and current generations on living on a safe and secure planet. And the production of meat is such an inefficient use of resources (food and water). Research estimates it takes twenty pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef, and 2500 gallons of water to produce on pound of beef! Like are you kidding me? Imagine a world where we grew crops to feed people in need, not grow crops in which 80% of them go just to feed livestock. Imagine a world where everyone at least tried to reduce their meat consumption. Research has shown crazy statistics like this "if a 4 person family skips steak once a week, its like taking their car off the road for 3 months". That's insane. There is no debate: Especially in today's society with the climate crisis, nobody is morally justified in eating meat. You want to help the fight? Give up meat (or only get meat from a local organic farm that only has a tiny environmental impact), vote, and try and influence others to do the same. People are inspired by those who's words are aligned with their actions.

<br><hr>
A absolutely agree with this post, and have found this one of the most frustrating aspects of the environmental movement. I feel like especially in this generation, people can post a "Save Australia" photo on their instagram story without actually taking action, and act like that is their contribution to saving the planet. When in reality this just gives a false idea of good morals. I was so guilty of this, and still often am, but being an environmental studies major and being enrolled in classes that are constantly discussing individual actions, I've decided to stop eating meat this year. As a college student it is incredibly difficult to feel like I have control over my influence on Earth, but small steps are helping me now. And I know that those will eventually lead to me making a bigger impact. It also takes events like the California fires and floods that are occurring at my front door that make me rethink how I act because I can see how small changes make a larger difference.
<br><hr>
I had a strong agreement with your opinion and I had a similar experience with you. I had taken a class which also discussed about climate change and I learned a lot about the negative influence of climate change and the causes of climate change, which means I should have a lot of knowledge about this. Indeed, I had some knowledge about the environmental crisis, and every time when I saw the horrible consequences and disasters caused by climate change, I really wanted to do something. When I knew that eating meat could cause a negative effect to climate change, I was astonished by this fact. I decided to eat more vegetables and gradually abandon eating meat. However, I did not insist this habit for a week. I love meat, it is so hard for me to give up eating meat. But at the same time, I know this habit is harmful for protecting the earth. What I choose to do is every time I eat meat, I tell myself that I should eat less or do not eat next time. But it is so hard to follow it. Just as you mentioned, “moral laziness” is the thing that I have now. I have an optimistic opinion about it, since people having this are better than the people who do9 not care about these issues anyway, because we got a chance to change one day.

Among affluent global civilizations, there are still some fragile societies that are suffering more or less due to changes in climate patterns. At present, for the people who are suffering, other parts of the world ca n’t mention it except for tinkering. Real solution.Although the scientific community around the world is shouting loudly, the current model of human civilization is dramatically changing the planet ’s climate conditions, and its consequences are likely to be several times the consequences that humans have experienced in the past 10,000 years. The main causes of the ongoing disaster are still inactive.

I find it unfortunately accurate how people perceive natural disasters as an issue for others to deal with until the storms are imposed onto them. The evidence is right in front of our eyes. The charred hillsides overlooking our campus. The degrading of the cliffside of the apartment complexes students in Del Playa Drive reside. It must be said that our contributions toward climate change with our choices and actions not only serve to harm others but ourselves. The urbanization that takes over metropolitan cities and the essentially stagnant political motions for amendments to mitigate the crisis have only established this state and our counties as a target for the environmental consequences. We can not afford to take the chance of waiting out on action to clean up our act.

The problem the article posts is really crucial. Santa Barbara now is a place with high risk of fire. Even though since 2015, the county tried to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by actually limiting its and other economic activities, there’s no change to the amount of greenhouse gas emission. Compared to 2007, there’s even 14 percent increase in the emission level. This increase in greenhouse made the temperature so high that leads to drought. According to the article, “At the time, the reservoir in the valley where much of Santa Barbara’s water originates was at just 6 percent of capacity. ” Lack of water is really a huge concern right now. In the future, people may run out of water. It’s really urgent to have solutions to prevent this end.

The article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" was very informative and quite eyeopening as it makes me consider things on a more local level instead of globally. The Paris Agreement discusses how as a planet we shouldn't exceed more than two degrees celsius in warming, but many counties are hitting that pretty closely. It's great that it was pointed out that Santa Barbara county needs to take more steps forward as they've maintained an environmentally conscious reputation, yet are failing to make the proper decisions that would prove that belief true. The mention of you saying that a tornado formed nearby is strange as that hasn't been a thing in California before, more so the midwest. California is increasingly getting warmer and the fires keep happening because dryer seasons are lasting longer. But there are problems elsewhere too when it comes to cars as they emit so much. This is an article that lets people understand that as individuals we need to recognize our faults and pursue this goal of bettering the planet together, but first communities need to branch together and deal with their place first.

The climate crisis is a world issue that is taking effect everywhere, including where I am, as I type this. I was slightly aware of the fact global warming was affecting everyone worldwide, but I wasn’t aware how close to home it had already hit. Everyone is aware of the issue, but no one truly feels personally affected by it until it reaches them on a personal scale. The fact that The Paris Agreement was created to keep climate change from reaching and essentially surpassing a whole 2 degrees is insane, but the fact that Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties have already surpassed that is mind-blowing. Reading the article “2℃: Beyond the Limit '' opened my eyes to an issue many residents- like myself- are not aware of, but must be informed immediately. The warming of the climate in the area in which we are living demands immediate attention and action before our beautiful cities suffer irreversible consequences.

<p>
It frightens me that the limit was only 2 degrees Celsius because at the current rate we are polluting our planet, we are on course to well surpassing that limit. Despite knowing the limit of our carbon emissions, we are still emitting the same amount as before, possibly even more. Why? we should ALL be scared of the consequences as it is soon becoming inevitable and soon. Wallace-wells highlights this possible future with his alarming article, 'The uninhabitable earth'. We are already experiencing the consequences of the global temperature rise with all the wildfires occurring. Strange weather phenomenons are occurring due to the temperature rise and people are still fighting the consensus that climate change is real and it is happening now.

It is scary to think that we attend school nearby the "fastest warming county in the lower 48 states" and we have faced a consequence of this temperature rise during the Thomas fire as well as other coastal counties. I remember contemplating whether or not I should go to class during the Thomas Fire and i did end up going while biking to class with a mask and was truly afraid until the school finally cancelled the rest of the quarter. This is not only endangering us humans but other types of life as well and it is truly saddening. I also would have freaked out if i was in Santa Barbara during the tornado warning and am grateful I was not, although i would have been praying for the people residing there. Wow, what a horrific notification to receive on your cell phone, especially on Christmas morning. Ken, you must have been grateful that you were not currently there when the warning occurred! Count your blessings!

Living in Los Angeles for the entirety of my life, I have indeed witnessed the effects of climate changed to some degree. Though minimal, I have seen changes the weather pattern as well as unusual or even record breaking temperatures. I remember some years when it was cold and rainy throughout the summer, yet temperatures would peak near 100 degrees in mid-October. There was also another instance when it hailed for the first time in years. However, the severity of the climate "crisis" does not really process in someone's mind until it has a direct effect on them. I first experienced this when I moved to Santa Barbara my freshman year. The Thomas Fire was an environmental catastrophe that plagued the county for a period of time. I remember the skies raining ash so heavily that it coated entire vehicles, barely being able to breathe through the thin face masks, and wondering if we'd be the next ones being told to evacuate. Watching "2C: Beyond the limit" made me the relive those daunting moments when I was suffering the consequences of human degradation of the planet. The most eye-opening aspect, however, was how quickly this event had slipped my memory, and the ease at which I went about my daily life, without a worry of the climate change that so recently had a prominent effect on my life. Living in Santa Barbara, we often get so encapsulated in the beauty of the city that we often forget how easily its beauty can be taken away if nothing is done regarding this problem that we face.

I have been in California since 2006. I remember when we first experienced droughts and thought it would last for only a summer. The wildfires were events that I would toss to the side mentally. I heavily understimated climate change because I did not see how it affected me personally. After the election, I started to pay attention. When Trump abandoned the Paris Climate Agreement, I started to worry. It is scary to read that Santa Barbara's temperature increases 2.3 degrees. It can get worse if the country does not action. California produces half of the country's fruit supply and I can only imagine what happens when the production decreases 5%. 

<br><br>
This article has made me wonder about the climate events that have happened in Santa Barbara. I am a third year student and I remember the fires my first year and the other fire that happened last quarter. It was really scary to know that this county has been hit hard with the effects of the climate change.

“2 degrees beyond the limit” clearly explains the manner in which global warming has directly and indirectly affected our beloved California. I thought it was quite revealing to read how nothing really happened in Santa Barbara until recently in regards to the random fires and mud slides but now because of the climate crisis, the facts is that continuously throughout the recent years there’ s an environmental disaster/anomaly that not only damages the natural environment but the daily routines and lives of humanity. For example, throughout my undergraduate career here at UCSB there has been a massive fire that caused ash to pour down upon us in the Santa Barbara, Goleta, Isla Vista, and surrounding areas. 
<br><br>

These fires have become such a recurring feature of California in the last couple of years and it is because we have made the climate hotter, drier, and windier through our devastation. It’s starting to become clear how the climate is going to play a role in destroying parts of our planet. Then there was the horrid rain pours that created a fatal mudslide occurrence that affected many human lives and caused the 101 near the Isla Vista entrance to be closed off for a substantial amount of time. Moreove, finding out  how the loss of moisture and the growing heat threatens the redwood trees is truly saddening.
<br><br>

In addition knowing that erosion is taking 78% of Santa Barbara’s bluffside beaches by 2060 is incredulous. Because of this erosion, there have been buildings on the Del Playa block that have crumbled into the beach.  It is up to us to put pressure on our elected officials to take the climate crisis seriously.

In the Washington Post article, “2 degrees C: Beyond the Limit”, it is outlined how the climate crisis and global warming are in fact starting to affect our everyday life even in a developed country, the USA. And, not only is it affecting our country, it is hitting hardest in one of the most popular states to live in: California. When people think of California they think of sunny beaches, dense forests, shopping and celebrities, however as the decades go on, due to the severity of the rise in our atmospheric temperatures, California, will continuously become a more and more dangerous location of residence. This hits hard for me since this fact of California’s future and how it is being affected by global warming is exemplified in a spot that I have just recently chosen to be my home for my collegiate chapter of my life: Santa Barbara. Neighbouring Ventura County’s average temperature has warmed, in  the past 25 years, more than any other county in the lower 48 states. This is a frightening fact for me as I just moved to Santa Barbara, as a freshman in college, about 4 months ago, and Santa Barbara’s average temperature has warmed only 0.3 degrees Celsuis less than Ventura’s temperature in the past 25 years, putting us on a path to feel effects of climate change in environmental turmoil much faster than nearly any other location in the country.
 <br><br>
Not only did the Thomas Fire and the Camp Fire take place in recent years in Santa Barbara county, some of the biggest fires in California’s history, just last quarter, a fire broke out which was so close to our dorm that parents were driving to Santa Barbara to pick up their children in fright, and groups of students were outside taking photos of how close this fire was to our residence hall. This should make some students wonder, about how they should change their everyday interactions with the world and the things they are purchasing which essentially put so much carbon emissions into the air from  production  that fires are a frequent occurrence, and our neighboring Monetecito faced deathly mudslides just a couple of years ago. I believe that the connection between these mind-boggling environmental disasters and the fact that our continued disregard for our environmental impacts cause these repercussions has been lost. This article does a fine job of not just alarming readers about the scary, long-term effects of a chaotic environment, but highlights how our use of fossil fuels are endangering our lives today, even in a place where it is incredibly expensive to live, catering to some of the more-educated and successful people--Santa Barbara, California.

I was surprised to learn that Santa Barbara is warming so much more than the rest of the world. However, I don't really see how the apartments that are caving in are relevant. The article seems to imply that this is because of climate change, but does not really elaborate. The cliffs that the apartment building is built on are inherently unstable, that is why they are cliffs. Geologically, the way these types of cliffs form is from erosion, so its not out of the ordinary for them to collapse occasionally, especially since they are mostly sedimentary rock. This would happen even without climate change, and it is something people should be wary of, but I think it is a bit sensationalist to include in this article.

Like the content in the article”2oC:Beyond the limit”, I have some intensive feedback. We are know the California is mild, Mediterranean climate with predictable weather.°C: beyond the limit is an excellent description of the harsh realities of the climate crisis in Santa Barbara and ventura counties and across California. Frankly, this article is a little depressing, because while Santa Barbara county has very passionate and committed residents and leaders who want to address the climate crisis, the county has not taken any progressive steps to address this huge problem. I know the crisis won't be fixed overnight, but it will mean hope for many residents and the rest of the world if we become active in the fight against climate change and could set a precedent for California and the rest of the world.
 <br><br>
Throughout my childhood, I didn't experience the same temperature as I had in the past few years. Berkeley has been experiencing fires, like the rest of California, because of the heat and lack of rain, something I never heard of when I was younger. A few years ago, in September, Berkeley experienced triple-digit temperatures that were typically around 74 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm not sure if these specific events are directly related to climate change, but it certainly makes you wonder. I believe this is a wake-up call that I need, because like some other people, I also believe that climate change is just an invisible entity that I don't have to worry about for the rest of my life, but now it's happening in my city. That's why I've chosen to make more conscious choices about my lifestyle, and I hope that many others will also accept that the climate crisis has not come, but has come.

“Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote.” This quote, which was made by Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams, is one that resonated with me throughout the majority of the reading. It’s crazy and surreal to think that we are already living in a world that is being heavily affected and changed by the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Growing up, I used to hear snippets here and there about how “global warming” (as it used to be called) was rising at an increased rate. I thought nothing of it and went on with whatever mundane task I had for that day. Today, it’s quite horrific knowing that you’re living next to one of the fastest warming counties in all of the lower U.S. states. Drastic effects have already taken place, such as the catastrophic Thomas Fire in 2017 that ended up killing 23 people in Montecito due to mudslides. 
 <br><br>


“We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” This is another quote that really stuck out with me in the reading. Our society chooses to instead adapt and find alternatives to this rapidly increasing climate change instead of grabbing the bull by the horns and taking the issue head on. Why don’t we just look for solutions that will fix this and put them in place instead of trying to counteract it? It is certainly affecting the livelihoods of many. One example for this is the farmers in and near Ventura County. Avocado, a water-reliant crop, has become much harder to harvest due to the significant lack of water over time. Because of this, farmers have now started to grow crops that are less water-dependent like agaves and dragonfruit. The issue here is that they are not sure if these crops will earn them a steady income, which could in turn negatively affect their lives. Ultimately, this reading serves to send the message that this problem of anthropogenic climate change is much, much closer than we have anticipated.

In the article we read, it really emphasized that local farmers and ranchers are being affected. As our county has experienced one of the highest rates of warming in the US (or the world...?),  our county has been feeling the effects that the rest of the US and Global North has done to the planet. In terms of climate justice, the global south and especially aftrica have not contributed that much at all to the climate crisis but are feeling the affects  way more so because they are reliant on subsistence farming and in many other ways feel the brut force of climate change way more than the global north. Santa Barbara being an affluent community in the north, you would not think that we would be affected that much but the reality of the situation is that we are feeling the affects in our own backyard. The whole tornado thing was unbelievable. I was at home in montecito at the time, and was thinking about evacuating again. It would have been tragic if the tornado had actually hit montecito, after all we have gone through. I didn't even know we could have tornado's in California, but I guess add it to the list of natural disasters that can strike us at any time!!!

After reading that article about Santa Barbara Wildfires, I am honestly impressed how well prepared everyone was when the Thomas fire hit Santa Barbara county. Professor Hiltner points out how there needs to be change to prevent these catastrophes can be prevented and I agree with it. There needs to be changes in one's habits to help prevent these events from taking place. However, with that being said, if no change happens then the next best thing we can do is stay prepared. Being prepared will not help reduce the climate but it will help save innocent lives.

The reading passage reveals some facts with Santa Barbara and Ventura. According to the agreement in Paris, temperature change must beyond 2 degrees. But across the world, the temperature change has exceeded 1 degree. In Santa Barbara, the temperature has increased 2.3 degrees. California should supply fruits and vegetables to the whole US, we cannot imagine if the temperature increases constantly, the food supply of US will be affected a lot. Also,25% residents are suffering high-risk fire. 2/3 people are living along the shoreline. If the temperature still is rising, flooding and fire will cause the danger of many people in California. It will be the problems of residents and government. Some catastrophes has happened. For example of the Thomas fire, it burned 218000 ares. Also the debris flow caused 30 people’s death. We must make some change.

Both of the reading and the video Ken posted have given me a clearer view of the impact of climate change on California specifically. Before this, as an international student, I didn’t know what exactly happened to this land due to climate change. I thought the fires that come to the town sometimes are norms. And I didn’t know that the little rise in temperature has already caused the houses near the coastline unstable and disappearing. Also, the severe drought caused by climate change did a lot of harm to the farmers and their plants and livestock. California might be one of the most harmed place in the world by climate change. In the video, I was taught that California supplies about half of the fruit of the whole country. Just imagine what would happen if the production drop by 10 percent because of climate change. 
 <br><br>

And it’s not just California, not just the United States. Climate change has caused significant tornadoes across the world, unexpectedly and unpredictably. There have been two tornadoes intertwined with each other and made more harm to the coastline. What’s more, the temperature in Santa Barbara has been more extreme than that in the past. The temperature has risen for almost 3 Celsius degrees and the nights are getting colder which kills livestock and plants like orchards. I think the whole nation, especially the government should do something about it and make the situation better, or they will face the consequences that come next.

As a Californian resident, it's easy to make jokes about how living in California is dangerous because of fires becoming more and more frequent. Being presented with numbers in the article definitely makes the situation very real, however, and seeing the negative impacts of erosion on the cliffs of DP as a result of climate change felt like a slap in the face. Being from Tulare County, I enjoyed the article's feature that showed different Californian counties and their recent temperature rise. It made me realize that my own home that I grew up is reaching higher and higher temperatures.

 <br><br>

It is upsetting that Santa Barbara, one of the cities that began the environmentalist movement, is still suffering at the negative consequences of the climate crisis. But it only shows that what we are doing and what we have done is not enough. The movement needs to grow larger and become more focused so that we can mitigate the damage we have done to the Earth. It only makes me angrier at climate change deniers; Californian fires have become so much more common recently, it's right in front of your eyes. Why doubt it? What else could be the cause?

Articles like these are always so astonishing, yet they pang my mind with this anger and sadness, as to see that this world is slowly deteriorating, yet we sit here and do nothing, and the worst part of it all is that, it's simply a choice that we choose to abide by because of the higher uppers. It's very surprising to see how Ventura one of the fastest-warming county in the lower 48 states, and Santa Barbara right next to it. It's truly astonishing, and hard to believe that one of the most scenic and beautiful cities in the state of California, filled with not only financial wealth, but wealth in vegetation and greenery and nature be affected by one of the most dangerous climate-related epidemics that we are currently facing. It's truly ironic, how this being a very wealthy city and pledging to reduce its carbon emission, had actually done the opposite and raised its emissions. But in the end, it's truly mind-boggling how we can acknowledge our errors and acknowledge the severe damage that we are causing our home and our planet and continue on with the same actions that will eventually doom us.

The first thing that I found the most astounding was the fact that the temperature has risen by 2.3 degrees C since 1985.  How/why has this not been in the news or talked about more? I also had no idea that exotic fruits like dragonfruit and passionfruit, and agave, were being grown here.  In my mind, those crops are from the tropics (and agave from Mexico), so how is it possible for them to be growing here?  This is what stands out and is the most concerning to me.  How is the warming not being talked about more? I feel like a global increase of 1.8 degrees C after Barak Obama warned that the maximum was 3.6 is very alarming and should be all over the news, yet this is the first time I have ever heard about it. I also had no idea that there had been freak occurrences where the temperature has soared to 115 randomly during the day then drop back down just as fast.  The fact that the three most severe fires in state history have occurred in the past two years is a fact that should frighten or shock me, yet sadly I am not surprised.  I also had no idea that Santa Barbara had ever had a tornado warning, and the fact that it actually touched down in Ventura is so alarming to me.  It was also very alarming to find out that although Santa Barbara county talks about "going green" and going "sustainable", yet the greenhouse gas emissions are up by 14%.  I think that this fact needs to be made more aware in the community so that the general public can voice their opinions and start moving towards solutions.  If enough people make their voices heard we can encourage change from lawmakers.

What is scary that fires are inevitable and many people cannot stop them from happening. As it states in the article, Ventura is settle fastest warming county in in the 42 states is very alarming and worrisome due to the fact that it very close to where I call home today. Along with the fact that the average temperature in Santa Barbara rose to a 2.3 degrees celcius i just devastating to hear. Not only do we have to worry about high sea Leven rise, or ground is being eroded little by little and nobody would ever come to think that we would have to worry about heat change especially at the beach. Well they thought wrong. It hurts to see that the sis happening in our very own backyard. A month ago students were able to see clearly the fires that begun just as where the Thomas fires appeared. The fear these people were facing just to think all their belongings and livelihood can be destroyed by a single fire.

As an international student who first live in California and study in Santa Barbara, I must say I was shocked by the content of this reading. While I am currently living here, I feel really comfortable with those California sunshine and had no idea about what has happened years ago, such as the forest fire and the collapse of cliff before I read this article. I was informed “life in Southern California, once as mild and predictable as the weather, is being transformed as the climate grows hotter, drier and in some regions windier, fueling more intense wildfires, deadly mudslides and prolonged extreme drought,” and “since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit).” It makes me anxious. Even though a lot of people know action needs to be taken to solve the climate crisis, yet are very hesitant to make lifestyle changes unless it is convenient to them. I mean, I myself have always made great efforts to save water, to commute in low-carbon ways, to eat as a vegan diet, but if it is only a one-person activity the environment will not be saved forever. To this extent, I am really pleased that this article can give such great details about previous disasters which, I believe, would definitely encourage the audience to stand out and actually do something.

I come from the Central Valley of California. It is mildly cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer, like temperatures that average around 110 degrees in mid-August. I escaped to Santa Barbara for college and was in awe of the weather. I don't think I've ever complained about it being too hot here and even in the winter as long as it's not raining its never too cold. It's jaw-dropping to think about the fact that not too long from now, Santa Barabara could be experiencing those same temperatures. This would be devastating for Ventura and Santa Barabara, no one here is used to those kinds of temperatures. The animals here aren't used to those kinds of temperatures. The plants aren't used to that kind of temperatures. It would be truly devastating to natural life in Santa Barbara. 
 <br><br>

This is where it really shows that humankind needs to come together and really get it together. We cannot keep living the way we are living and expect things to be okay for future generations. The article was very interesting to me in particular because Santa Barbara is home for me, at least for now. And it really did hit close to home.

As another average resident of Southern California, it has always felt like it should be up to the older generations to address the climate crisis and the fires that come around every year. But even at home, my own dad has trouble grasping the idea that our species is truly making a difference on this earth. Like most people, if something doesn’t directly affect me then I have no reason to do anything about it. A sort of “minding my own business” mentality. However, with articles like Scott Wilson’s “2°C: Beyond the Limit,” it’s hard to avoid the harsh reality about where our lives are heading in the coming years. The temperature increases seem minimal from a general standpoint, but the fact that wildlife, forests, and even deserts must suffer from our actions, like “desert habitats losing 43 percent of their species in the past century” NEEDS to be a wake-up call. But I know that’s not how our world works. No matter how hard our most devoted activists try to enact change, our society will continue to be dominated by our drive to make more money and we will soon forget of events like the fires in Australia right now. I commend humanity for our resilience and adaptability, but one day our great-great- grandchildren or someone in our family line will see the world at its end and all I can do now is feel sorry that they didn’t get to experience life like I did. It won’t be long before the cliff houses in IV are no more, and until then, I’m just going to hope I never have to see more destruction.

I think the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit” was very impressive and shocked me about the detail about climate change and how serious can climate change be. I know that climate change is affecting the whole world. But I don't know how serious it is. This article let me know how serious the problem is at this point. And I don't know that Santa Barbara is now becoming one of the most affected cities in the United States of America. I think Santa Barbara is nice, this place is like a vacation village, but I can't imagine that Santa Barara is facing the threat of a tornado. Its temperature has risen by over 2.3C in the past few decades. And the mountain fire we have last year gives us a clear view of how serious can climate change be and what is the impact that it can bring with. I strongly suggest people start to do somethings to save our plant.

The reading, 2°C: Beyond the Limit, Fires, floods and free parking, is a continuation of last week's reading, where it specializes climate crisis into intense wildfire in California. Recalling last week’s reading about severe consequence of 2°C rising of global temperature, this reading points out that “the average temperature in Santa Barbara County, where we are in, has warmed by 2.3°C since 1895”. At this point, I realize that climate crisis has already approached us in silence, and it’s the time that we should face the problem directly. However, after experiencing the shock of the facts, I feel ashamed that as a college student studying in Santa Barbara not paying attention to the negative impacts of climate crisis on the community I live in. Also, the reading tells an interesting and ironic fact that Santa Barbara was the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, yet nothing has done to reach its anti-pollution goals. Various evidences show that California is facing rigorous climate crisis. It’s our duty to protect our living community from climate crisis.

I think I am gradually realizing the seriousness of the climate change. From the last film, reading, and lecture comments I expressed my emotion of how far is the climate change away from us. However, the reading brought me to the fact that it is happening right now just a couple of miles from me. The fire was burning abruptly and aggressively behind where I am living. The causes of the fire is just in front of my eyes as a UCSB student. The causes of the climate change is also be told in the reading, and it is very serious according to the video. I hope I can get start and do something for the world and California.



</p><hr>


<p>
I honestly do not know how to fathom what I read and viewed in the video above. It is just so crazy to see that Climate Change is here already and it is not even occurring that far away, it is literally a city over. This is not even the worst of what might happen because we are continuously dumping CO2 into the atmosphere exhilarating the crisis and we are still doing the bare minimum to address the issue appropriately. At what point will we realize that we need to take action now because it is only going to get worse as time moves forward.

 <br><br>

It is surprising that Earth Day and the wave of environmentalism started in Santa Barbara, yet we are not one of the leading cities that are trying to reduce emissions to a minimum. Other cities may look to Santa Barbara to adopt similar practices to reduce emissions and as mentioned in the article, if Santa Barbara is not doing everything they can to mitigate climate change, why would other cities do the same? It could lead other cities to not know what to do or seen as something urgent because there is no model to implement to create change. Not saying that other cities have to wait on Santa Barbara to take action, but if no one else is doing it, other cities may be less likely to do something. 

 <br><br>

With the Thomas Fire that affected the Ventura and Santa Barbara County, it seems like motives to address climate change will only occur when a catastrophe affects the people themselves. I feel as if this is a poor mentality to have because it means that people will only care about an issue unless it affects them directly. This sends the message that although climate change is affecting everyone in the world, particularly those in poorer nations, it only matters when it affects you. I hope this mindset can change and look at this issue as something that needs to be solved because it is the right thing to do.

The effects of the climate crisis are often overlooked because they aren't a huge direct impact to people's day to day lives. We can view the effect on our very own Santa Barbara county where the degree has risen 2 degrees. This may seem irrelevant in the larger scheme of things. We may not notice the difference between 60 and 62 degrees or the heat rise between 85 and 87. Yet we have to realise these two degrees have a lasting impact on the planet. California has gone through a drought that has direct correlation with the climate crisis. Most people didn't see the drought being connected to climate but the drought directly affected water and energy bills. Dryer grass and overall land. There is even an incentive for people to plant desert plants in their yard and then the government would give you money for the water saving landscape. This was evident in  many low income neighborhoods where people would change their yards simply for the money. Not being a fan of desert plants myself it was sad to see the green grass gone replaced by prically cactuses and rocks.If the different yards does not represent the world we are going to end up with then I don't know what does. At the end of the day is no change is taken we will be life with a dry bland earth.

The article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" effectively displays the seriousness of the current situation with climate change. It was really impressive and opened my eyes to the details behind the climate crisis. I apprehended that global warming is influencing everywhere on the earth right now, but I never thought that Santa Barbara is becoming one of the most affected cities in the U.S. The average of the temperature has risen by over 2.3 C. The mountain fire that happened during last November was the first time I see the consequences of climate change in a really short time. The sky is under the color gray for a few days. The article also mentioned the cliff erosion in Isla Vista, and many houses there are already supported by some concrete pillars. All those things have not happened of a sudden. However, most people still don't take responsibility for their actions. It is unfortunate to see that not even a climate change proactive city would fully fight against environmental change.

The mild and predictable weather that once characterized the central coast of California is quickly transforming into drastic unpredictable climate change catastrophes. Reading this article I was astonished by the statistics. Reading that the warning threshold set by the 2015 Paris Agreement has already been surpassed in this region was shocking. How can it be? Prior to attending UCSB, I had no idea Santa Barbara was one of the original places where the environmental movement began, yet I learned very quickly that UCSB is truly a special place that has such a caring and organized student body willing to take on any social justice issue. While it is upsetting that Santa Barbara County is not capable of protecting the environment or meeting it’s anti-pollution goals to reduce emissions, I believe the younger generations residing in Santa Barbara are pushing for a more sustainable county. There is so much room for improvement and I think we have the perfect space and  resources for this to happen, it’s just a matter of making it a priority. Hopefully this happens before it’s too late.

The washington post article, "2C Beyond The Limit" by Scott Wilson, exposed a lot of the predicted effects of climate change. I think the most impactful part of this article is that the effects are here, sooner than anyone could have expected. It is devastating to see how some people's life are directly affected by climate change but for others, the environmental crisis is seemingly invisible. Wilson writes on specific businesses in southern California that have had to make adjustments to stay competitive in a market that is being drastically changed by environmental causes. Ultimately I feel as though the rest of the population will have to make changes as well. But these changes will not be to save our planet, simply just to save ourselves. I have serious doubts about the willingness to give up comfort in humans, and by way of our luxurious and extravagant spending habits, we will most likely never reach the goal of staying below a global temperature rise of 2C as agreed upon in the Paris Climate agreement. Our changes will certainly be to adapt to the environment in ways that will, at the very least, make our house habitable. If the temperature goes up, people will just buy air conditioning. If the sea level rises, people will just move inland. There are so many ways to adapt to the environment because that is what we have done for thousands of years. But I don't want to keep killing our planet. That's why I am excited for the next few lessons which will actually talk about how we can change for the betterment of planet Earth.

My whole life I’ve lived in Santa Barbara County, and have had the misfortune of watching it deteriorate throughout the years. Many can attempt to say that California is an incredibly environmentally conscious state when the truth is that behind those words, we’re a state just as willingly ignorant as any other. This article only highlights this about us. Starting with the Thomas Fire which was the biggest wildfire in much of history, this article proved to show that even the risk to the lives of the general public has not been enough to convince people of the huge danger of climate change. 
 <br><br>

Perhaps, that is what I found scariest because time and time again even with the lives of countless people already taken and the fires only worsening it is still not enough. People are choosing to believe that climate change isn’t real when it has been sitting right above our heads for the past few decades. I ask myself these questions then: What number of lives lost will make people change and how far gone will this county have been destroyed by the time people see what’s going on?

Two years ago, I wrote an essay on how Santa Barbara has been a roadrunner in the green movement after the 1969 oil spill,  due to the communtiy’s investment in sustainable development and environmentally friendly ways of living. This article was eye opening and I was ignorant to the fact that Santa Barbara  has faced the repercussions of climate change and the worst has yet to come. Since being here, I have witnessed an increased flux of forest fires, droughts, and mudslides. 
 <br><br>

The average temperature has increased by 2.3 degrees Celsius in Santa Barbara and the consequences of climate change and global warming has been right in front of us. Santa Barbara is at risk of being displaced in the future if we do not contribute to this fight. 
 <br><br>

The Thomas Fire resulted in 23 deaths and homes in Isla Vista are at risk of further damage due to rising sea levels. The fears that plague our minds regarding climate change are already here and this artel prompted a sense of urgency within out community. This should be read in classrooms across the campus and community in order to shed light on what we are currently living in and will only worsen without any action.

The article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" leaves me feeling uneasy about the future. What specifically caught my attention was about how the coastal parts that go through Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and part of the Mexican border are warming up more quickly than the continental United States. We currently live in Santa Barbara, so we're directly affected. I'm from Los Angeles so my family is also affected. On top of that, my parents' home country is also being affected, which makes me feel as if it is inescapable. 

 <br><br>

The quotes of how people from Santa Barbara are almost simply accepting that some of their cliff side homes might not be there in a few years due to the rising sea level is scary in its own sense. I find this mentality a huge detriment to possible solutions that could very well happen. I tend to see myself as an optimist, and those people should be some of the main ones helping or seeking a possible solution.

I really enjoyed the article “2°C: Beyond the Limit” by Scott Wilson because it was extremely informative of the effects of climate change that are currently occuring and will continue to do so. While I have taken other courses that have covered a bit on climate change, I have not have had an in depth course that really informs me about what is currently occurring, what will occur, how I contribute to climate change, and what I could and should be doing to alter my lifestyle to make a positive impact. Growing up in the Central Valley, one thing we are told is how we are responsible for a large part of the food production in the United States, so reading in the article how significant climate change to the climate of regions is a danger is alarming. Also, I would like to ass that weather changes have already been felt, as our summers continue to feel hotter and hotter. I remember hearing Ken inform us in lecture how Ventura is the fastest-warming county and to read it and see the actual number of degrees it has warmed by was saddening. It’s both frightening and disappointing to see that climate change really affects every aspect around us and many policymakers choose to ignore and deny the consequences rather than try to fix them and listen to those concerned in their communities.
 <br><br>

While reading this article, I stumbled upon lots of information I was unaware of, and some that I had already learned about. In my second quarter of my freshman year at UCSB, I learned about the oil spill that occurred in Santa Barbara. Also, it became evident because of the tar on our feet, like the article mentions. However, I did not know that this incident was the “third-largest spill in U.S. history”, nor that it sparked Earth Day. Through this article, I learned that Santa Barbara county pledged to lower their “greenhouse gas emission by 15%”, but they have in fact failed to do so. Instead of lowering it, they have actually increased them. I was not surprised to find that out, but it does make me want to ask a few important questions about why this is happening. I think this article is something more people in this county should read if they have not already and really get an understanding of what is happening.




</p><hr>


<p>

Prior to reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit," I had no idea that Santa Barbara County has warmed by a staggering 2.3ºC on average, with Ventura County somehow warming to an even greater 2.6ºC, making it "the fastest-warming county in the Lower-48 states." I never would have thought that the warming effects of climate change would be this severe already, not to mention so close to home. Keeping these statistics in mind, seeing that Santa Barbara officials have also conceded to lobbyists when considering green policy proves to be extremely concerning, particularly after reading that  "in 2015, the county pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent compared with 2007 levels. Two years later, a progress report found that, rather than reducing those emissions, Santa Barbara was actually exceeding its 2007 levels by 14 percent." If the area that requires immediate climate action due to drastically increasing temperatures fails to step up, how can California, supposedly one of the most progressive states as far as climate change is concerned, and the rest of the United States for that matter, be expected to suddenly and dramatically combat climate change? One would think in a state as significant as California, where half of America's produce comes from and 40 million people call home, not to mention the birthplace of Silicon Valley and major cities like Los Angeles, climate policy would not only be enacted swiftly and easily but also be comprehensive and steadily enforced so that the state could serve as a prime model for the rest of the country to follow and take note of. There's almost no point in electing officials who vow to combat the climate crisis if they turn out to be empty campaign promises that vanish in the presence of bribes from organizations that benefit greatly from our inaction.

After reading  the article "2ºC, Beyond the Limit," my eyes were opened to the fact that climate change is extremely unforgiving, and its effects occur everywhere- even in our beautiful backyard of Santa Barbara. I find it amazing (in the least positive way) how the cliffs that are slowly eroding on Del Playa are actually affecting the safety of the residents living along the coastline in Isla Vista. Although I am not living there this year, I move in next winter and I have feelings of worry and concern for the house I will be in. We see all that is happening around us, anthropogenic effects of climate change, and it feels like we talk about the issue, but how much do we actually do as a community? None, or at least nothing. The way students, myself guilty, trash isla vista as it is some sort of utopian society where trash will magically disappear with no harm, is sickening. I have never seen such a bubble of a beautiful environment littered with the heartless remains of the community. So, what do we do? The climate is calling for an answer now, but I don't think we can give one.

<p>

To begin with, the article used the experiences of the camping resort manager, Terri Bowman, to show the reader about the serious issues due to climate change. It appears that there are more wildfires and mudflows in recent years, which are very dangerous natural disasters that can cause huge damage to people and properties. In the article, it talks about how calm and well prepared Bowman is that she takes good care of the visitors and is always ready to protect them from natural disasters. It is both weird and scary to know that people are starting to get used to the drought,  wildfires and the unusual rains with mud after the fire. The article suggests that those environmental issues happen due to climate change and global warming that the average temperature of Santa Barbara has already risen by 2.3 degrees celsius. 
 <br><br>

The climate change is not only affecting humans, but also animals and plants. According to the article, the drought decreases the moisture in the air and soil that threatened the life of the redwood forests in California, and the birds population drops due to the lost and change of habitats. It is very sad to read an article like this, and it also raise the awareness to do something to improve our world, stop global warming and limit the damages caused by climate change. It is urgent and necessary for more people to know and be educated about the environmental issues in society that it is going to affect everyone on the planet.



</p><hr>


<p>

The “2°C: Beyond the limit” article shed a light on a few ideas that resonated with me. First, we can no longer think of climate change as a distant and abstract concept. As Ken points out, it is happening now, and it’s happening everywhere. A lot of people view the climate crisis through an ‘out of sight out of mind’ lense. We hear about these disasters that are happening all over the world: the fires in the Amazon rainforest, the earthquake in Puerto Rico, the Australian brush fires, etc. Our response, as a society, is to post on our social media, “Pray for Australia” or share a list of things that everyone can do to help, as if we are truly heartbroken at these crises occurring outside of our line of sight. Yet behind these outcries, we continue to go about our lives as if nothing is happening. In a world that is more connected than ever, it’s crazy that we are so disconnected from the realities that surround us. I think we have come to foster a sense of immunity and desensitization toward these extreme weather events and not only their physical and social impacts, but the ripple of consequences that are set in motion. 
 <br><br>

That is until we get hit in the face with one, as we were with the Thomas Fire and the following Montecito Debris Flow. The shock waves that were sent throughout our communities served as a rude awakening. For awhile, people began to talk about these events and their relationship to the climate crisis with a sense of urgency. But on a grander scale, it has started to fade into the background. As time has passed, the motivation to make real and effectual changes, has slowly diminished. This ties in with the statement that Santa Barbara cares more about how it looks, than how it lives. As the article points out, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have already surpassed the target set forth in the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to ‘well below’ 2°C. In addition, Santa Barbara has not only failed to meet its 2015 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, but has actually done the exact opposite and increased ghg emissions by 14% since 2007 levels. As the “birthplace of the modern environmental movement” and a place that has already seen climate change up-close and personally, we would expect to see more being done to address it, but unfortunately we are not.



</p><hr>


<p>

As I look at the beautiful scenery of Santa Barbara, it makes me sad and alarmed that all of this has the possibility of being gone within this century, most likely even earlier if we continue the path of releasing greenhouse gases at our current rate. It is easy to stay ignorant and continue on with our lives and believe that climate change actually happening far away and cannot affect us. However, this is far from the truth. Climate change is happening everywhere and already affects us, especially here in Santa Barbara
 <br><br>

I did not personally experience the Thomas fire that occurred in December 2017 and only heard stories about what happened from the upperclassmen. Recalling the horrible stories that my friends told me makes me want to reconsider my current lifestyle to help emit less greenhouse gases. However, I know that simply thinking about changing my current lifestyle will do nothing. In fact, it is easier to simply think about changing a certain part of one’s lifestyle than going through with it because executing the action requires a conscientious effort while thinking about it does not require any commitments. During my first year at Santa Barbara, I was guilty of just thinking about making a change because I did not directly witness the consequences of climate change. However, everything changed this school year after I witnessed the Cave fire right before winter break. Even at that time, I was unaware that the fire was the result of climate change. But reading the article reading the article 2°C: Beyond the Limit and enrolling in this class opened my eyes on our dangerous path of almost losing our precious scenery and I am determined to take action instead of becoming idle.

After reading the article "2ºC: Beyond the limit," there was a line that really struck out to me while I read it. "This is like climate change writ small - you know it's coming, but you are not preparing." Before I had arrived to UCSB, climate change was something that I thought didn't apply to my life. Even though I live on the same planet as everyone else, I thought it couldn't impact me for some reason. With that thinking I never did anything out of my normal efforts of reusing, reducing, and recycling. The Thomas Fire was one of the first indicators that this thinking and bubble I had put myself in was about to shatter. I'll never forget driving back home to Orange County and seeing the flames consume the surrounding area near the freeway. It's one thing to hear about fires on the news but a different thing to experience it for yourself. Despite all the memes we had all created about the Thomas Fire and laughed at, I think deep down we were a bit afraid of what this could mean. As I continued my education at UCSB and switched my major to Environmental Studies, it made me realize the extent of the climate crisis the media doesn't portray. It forced me to come to terms with myself that I had done nothing to prepare by switching my habits. However, even now I have difficulties limiting my own carbon emissions which makes me think of how many other people are not doing what is necessary to slow down climate change despite knowing about it. 
 <br><br>

Another part of the article that made me feel a bit sad to read was when Bowman said "We just kind of shifted into action, we were so used to it." I don't think any human being should be subjected to think a fire is something that just happens at least once annually, especially when climate change is one of the reasons for the increase. It's sad to think that some climate change events are  just a normal occurrence to some people now.

Ventura & Santa Barbara counties are seemingly on the frontline of attack from global climate change.The situation is jarring and daunting for a number of reasons. First, for each of us here, there is a very real threat coming from the instability of the weather. What was once a temperate part of the California coast is now experiencing odds weather pattens, likely as a result of the 2° temperature spike. 
  <br><br>
Secondly, the severity of the consequences aside, it’s happening detectably in an area very near if not immediately near to us. The Washington Post article reminds us the importance of thinking about how dire the situation at hand may be.



</p><hr>


<p>

People might wonder, if the repercussions of shifting temperatures were expected, why didn't anyone take proper preparation before global warming took effect in the regions where they lived in, in this instance, California's west coast region? The Paris climate accords warned us that if temperatures rose above 2 degrees celsius, our earth would face catastrophic events sooner or later. The temperature in Santa Barbara has gone up to 2.3 degrees celsius since 1985, after environmental regulation that was meant to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and in other words, avoid temperatures from rising. Then the next major question is, why have they not met their goals yet? 
  <br><br>


Scientists have considered urbanization as being one of the contributors to higher temperatures in SB. Urbanization releases a heavy amount of greenhouse gases which consequently makes the earth undergo near extreme weather conditions. At this current rate of heat moving up, regulations that have already been enforced are losing effectiveness because they are competing with the growth rate along with other factors.

The article “2 degrees C: Beyond the Limit” does a good job of explaining the severity of the climate crisis within California. As mentioned in the video, the climate grows hotter, drier, and windier, fueling fires, prolonged drought, and mudslides. According to almost a century of data, the coastal curve that bends south from Santa Barbara to LA is warming at double the rate of the continental US and that is extremely frightening. During the past 5 years, the heating has accelerated and now Ventura county is heating up the most quickly in the lower 48. We are seeing the effects of climate change across species as warming oceans throw oyster, crab, and urchin harvests into disarray, and bird populations are ravaged by drought. Scientists predict that by 2060, 78% of seaside bluffs will be gone due to erosion and for me, it’s crazy to think how close this hits home. I’ve fallen in love with the beauty of Santa Barbara and its horrible to think that the same experience won’t be available in a matter of years. I am just saddened because we have all this evidence for essentially the end of the world and the right actions are not being taken. We see it in the national bureaucracy as President Trump has promised to leave the Paris Accords. I think its simply stupid that he pushes the country to produce these fossil fuels to sustain an economy because he doesn't realize what this will mean for the economy of the future. If he truly cared about the economy he would realize the need to save the planet as the destruction of our natural resources will ravage multiple industries. Furthermore, it is frightening to realize that the control of the fossil fuel industry in our nation extends throughout all levels. Santa Barbara has been described as an environmental poseur due to its talk about environmentalism and its actual actions. In 2015 the county promised to reduce emissions by 15% compared with 2007 levels, but a report 2 years later found that it was exceeding the levels in 2007 by 14%. This makes me extremely worried because people here have the resources and the knowledge of the need to change, but they continue to not care in exchange for short term wealth.

The passage talks about the place of our school, Santa Barbara County. The introduction of the recent wildfire raised my echos. I still remembered that day when I went out for morning courses, the air smelt like ashes and haze was in the air so thick that spotting persons 50 meters away is hardly possible. From wildfire, the author continues to introduce the warming effect of Santa Barbara in recent years, which is quite dramatic. The rise is labeled dark red in the picture, showing a tremendous increase of more than 1 degrees so far after the signature of Paris agreement. The consequence is no doubt catastrophic too. Mentioned by professor in the lecture, although people here in California had no idea about disasters other than sea-level rise when it comes to global warming consequences, they are actually experiencing many more, including mud erosion and ocean creature death. Especially, professor mentioned an anecdote that he was alerted about a tornado years before. Being given the background that Santa Barbara county is Mediterranean climate, one of the most pleasant climates in this world, I am shocked to realize that even in this good condition, tornadoes had potential to strike the county. As climate change increases the instability of climate, being hot in the noon and cold again at night, may raise air disturbance and in sequences, give birth to a tornado. However, what I am thinking about is people’s awareness. Our recognition of climate changes can never keep up with the scale that it already is. Therefore, it is important for experts and governments to update the new information about climate consequences to the public in time, so that the increasingly attention is drawn and therefore the action is taken.

In the article, “2℃: Beyond the Limit,” by Scott Wilson, he explains how rising temperatures are affecting Southern California cities, mostly focusing on Santa Barbara and Ventura County. I was surprised and also disappointed to learn that Santa Barbara County failed to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases in 2015, and instead increased their levels. I never knew that the climate crisis was making such an immense impact in Santa Barbara, or Isla Vista. I always assumed that the cliff erosions below properties on Del Playa were due to natural deterioration, not a result of rising temperatures. I was also shocked to learn from this article that Ventura County “ranks as the fastest-warming county…”. 


  <br><br>

Most Californians know how the consequences of climate change are affecting the city/state we live in, but we are not doing enough about it and instead, we are just watching our environment fall apart. After discovering the effects that climate change has contributed to certain parts of California, I began to wonder why the majority of Californians are not taking it seriously. Our lack of action will continue to increase the repercussions we face due to the alarming rates of rising temperature.

As a freshman in ucsb, i always consider Santa Barbara as a place suitable for living and vacation 
  <br><br>
because of its beautiful environment. Large amount of trees, birds, little animals, the blue sea, the blue sky and the breeze in Santa Barbara, all of these leave me a environmental beautiful and friendly impression.
  <br><br>
However, i feel shocked when i finished the reading. I can’t believe there is a corrupt environmental management behind a city with a beautiful appearance and the city have so many threats and potential danger. It’s hard to believe that the “living suitable place” is actually threatening residents’ safety. 
  <br><br>
I felt really angry when i read the part that the government was actually opposing the environmental regulation and this cause, according to data, exceeding level of greenhouse gas by 14 percent. However, the county pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 15 percent. And i got more angry and upset when i was getting to know the serious environmental consequences showing in the city which was actually can be prevented or at least lightened. The increasing temperature and the disasters, flood and fire, causes by increasing greenhouse gas causes many damages to the life in the city. Some marine organism, flying birds, and even humans were being killed by those environmental problem and it will continually threatening us.
  <br><br>
The reading make me recall the tar on under my feet when i walking on the beach near the campus. However, after reading the passage i feel like the government didn’t take any effective action and they don’t have the determination of improving environment. The government is just giving empty talk.
  <br><br>
There’s no more time for us to be hesitate about saving environment and saving lives. Not only government should take effective actions as soon as possible, we all should do something in our daily life and help make a difference on environment.

After reading the article, "2ºC: Beyond the Limit", it saddens me that Santa Barbara has not kept up on their part of keeping emissions down. I always believed that Santa Barbara was a very eco-friendly town but to learn that instead of reducing our emissions, we have actually increased them proves otherwise. I never had connected free parking to the amount of cars on the road but it makes total sense. It places like Los Angeles you almost always have to say for parking and I think if we did something like that here in Santa Barbara, then more people would bus or bike downtown. Also, considering our town is so small, it would not be that inconvenient. A new law was created in Santa Barbara not too long ago to ban single use plastics like plastic grocery bags, plastic take out/plastic straws but I have noticed that many places do not participate in this new rule. I think the city should be more strict about it and start fining people who don't cooperate so that people are more willing to use paper and bring their own bags. I think that this would make a huge difference.

As a student coming from the other part of the world, I have never experienced wild fires that were just few minutes away by car. Especially Cave Fire last year, it was clearly visible right after I finished my class outside my classroom. It is despairing how human's destructive manners bring chains of consequences. Obviously, more severe and intense natural changes and disasters. And a quarter of 40 million Californian residents are under risks. Yet still, according to “2ºC: Beyond the Limit", Santa Barbara county and several other counties in California are doing the opposite from their promises of lowering temperatures.
  <br><br>


I could not agree more on Evan Steinberg's comments about "moral laziness". Why take actions when it is easier not to? Such mentality is what accelerates the warming of the Earth. And while the situation is getting worse, I quote "We know it is coming, but we are not preparing." It is disappointing how people somewhat realized the crisis is hitting their lives yet still too busy to take actions and make changes. More specifically, I am disappointed at myself for not taking actions as early as possible. I hope something changes after finishing this class.

I think it is absolutely astonishing to see people in the Santa Barbara area, or anywhere near it, being in support of oil companies. Santa Barbara is, like you mentioned, one of the most afflicted areas of the climate crises with temperatures exceeding far beyond the norm everyday. These people see the fire, like with the Thomas fire, in their own backyards and they will still they to place more oil rigs along our coastline. Its sad and terrifying how little some people care about the environment and about our own future. I was here as a freshman when we had to get evacuated for the fires at UCSB, it was a scary reminder that the climate crises is here and it effects us all. To even think that a temperate place like Santa Barbara cab have tornadoes and hurricanes is crazy on its own, but its also scary because those can be disastrous for the delicate ecosystems that live in the goleta county. Overall a very terrifying and real threat here.

It is astonishing that we can actually feel the climate change right now, not just heard about it from news anymore. Climate change has caused trouble to people living along coast lines. However, it is sad that few people are taking action to slow down those effects. Every time mentioning about climate change, people should not just feel sad; instead, taking action is more effective to stop struggling from global change.

After reading "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" it amazes me at how rapidly the world around is heating up. To think the fastest heating county within the lower 48 states in right next to Santa Barbara is a very scary thought. Santa Barbara seems like a paradise to us and to think its in danger of heating passed than what the Paris Accords agreed on is mind blowing. with all of California heating up the entire state could risk not only having more droughts but also having more and more fires. The Thomas fire was just one example of how the rising temperatures only bring more harm and no good to us.

Basically anyone who lives in California can relate to this article. If you ask someone who’s lived in California for more than a decade, they will have a personal story about climate change. My mom will talk about local fires becoming a bi-annual event (on a good year), my dad will talk about the wash behind the house he’s lived in for 40 years running dry in 2003 and never refilling, my grandparents about the mudslides that have closed the freeway twice already this year, my friends about the fires that melted the screens off their windows and scorched the grasses in their backyards. I don’t want to say that this article is any less effective than other articles on the more intimate details of climate change becuase I’m sure to others it’s just as good. But honestly I’m feeling a little desensitized. Having inclimate weather for two weeks due to smoke was normal. Evacuating twice a year and rolling our eyes as we lug the photo albums into the car was normal. Hearing stories like the ones in the article and the ones above is normal. Which hella depressing I guess. For people who aren’t used to this maybe it’s a lot more effective but it just seems like nothing new right now. 
   <br><br>
The section I found most pressing was the portiion that described the effects climate change was having on the redwoods, bird populations, and kelp forrests. We have a pretty human-centric view of the climate crisis sometimes, maybe because we naturally think of ourselves when we hear “CATASTROPHIC DANGER” but reading about how the redwoods might die sent a genuine pang down my chest. You hear about the rainforrests and coral reefs dying and it feels sad in a kind of foreign way like when a friends grandparent dies, but the redwoods feel so huge and magic and intrinsically part of California life. Lame and hippie sentiments. So I guess this works in the opposite way that the above part didn’t. Familarty for our own “selfish” struggles vs thinking about the effects on things bigger than ourselves. Oof. 
   <br><br>
It was also very interesting to see a mapped out time scale of one area’s evolution through climate change. I think it really emphasized how many different ways the climate change will hit us. It was very effective device wise, and made good use of graphics and pictures. Entertaining like watching a sad documentary is enteraining: uncomfortable, attention grabbing, but overall informative.

What I took away from the article is that climate change can, will, and is already affecting every aspect of human (and animal, and plant) life. Some of these changes we see coming - sea level rise, average temperature increases and migration, to name a few. Others we don’t, like the unexpected tornado warning in Santa Barbara that Ken mentioned, as well as other freak weather incidents causing harm all over the globe more and more frequently. The kind of change I hadn’t paid much thought to until reading this article, however, was change on a local level; the ways that climate change will affect local economies, alter the habitats of creatures that have resided in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties for millennia, and change the way of life for some regions much faster than others.
    <br><br>
The effect on local farming is especially worrying and saddening. Guner Tautrim, a seventh-generation farmer, is just one in the area who suffered losses due to intense heat spikes that the local landscape has yet to recover from. The article left me wondering how California will tackle the rapidly growing issue of farming losses, possibly adapting as Eric Hvolboll of La Paloma Ranch has in growing agave in order to continue farming with a lack of water and hotter temperatures.

It is incredible how close we are to extinction. After reading "2°C: Beyond the Limit",  I was astounded to learn that even though Santa Barbara seems to be a paradise we may be close to devastation. Ventura county being home to the largest increase in temperature is a revelation to me. All around California land is becoming a fire risk zone that could potentially put 40 million people in danger. A constant increase of greenhouse gases are to blame. It is clear that this should be a wakeup call for all Californians that climate change is real and we must find solutions and contribute less fossil fuels into the world. If we do not act now we may not have our beautiful home anymore.

After reading this article it opened my eyes to how I am seeing and experiencing the effects of climate change in my life and my families lives. This article makes me reflect on how the climate crisis has affected me. I have lived in a small town in the Central Valley my whole life and it is always so hot there in the summer and in the winter it doesn’t get that cold. In the summer of 2016, I frequently saw machines that were creating new wells because so many wells had run dry including my families. There was a serious drought going on and it affected so many people. My family had to use water from our neighbors house and make sure we weren't wasting water. Growing up I have always wanted to move away from Fresno because it got so hot there and I wanted to live by the beach because there is always perfect weather there and nothing can go wrong. When it came time to decide where I was going for college it was between CSU Fresno and UCSB. I chose UCSB for various reasons but one of them being the perfect weather. I have visited home various times since arriving in September of 2019. I came to Fresno two days ago and as soon as I arrived I realized that it was a lot colder than I thought it would be. I told my uncle that had it was a lot colder in Fresno than in Santa Barbara and he didn’t believe me because the beach was colder than home. Realizing that the Santa Barbara area keeps getting hotter and hotter is alarming because I have always known the beach to have sometimes hot but mostly cool weather. I live and go to school here now and I am concerned for what will happen to this place if it just keeps getting worse. It’s sad to think about what could happen if people don’t start stepping up and do their part. I know that I am not very climate conscious but after learning more and more about the potential issues we are facing, it makes me want to change and become more aware of the things I can do.

After reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit," I found it very astonishing that climate change has become so effective to the point where we people can experience the environmental damages in our everyday lives. And additionally, many residents in Santa Barbara are expressing their beliefs and values about climate change. But the city is not able to act on the goals efficiently as much as the residents would like it to. It is very saddening and frustrating that not only Santa Barbara but also other parts of the world are not acting on this issue when our human actions of releasing greenhouse gasses are affecting our homes and environment. If people don't act on this issue, then our planet will be constantly damaged to the point where there is no going back. Media and politics should stop ruining our planet for once by portraying this problem as irrelevant and false.

When I first began taking this class I was not too interested in attending lecture three times a week and hearing about a long and ongoing discussion which I believed I was rather sufficiently informed about already. It is now week two of reading articles and watching videos and I am becoming more and more interested to learn the nitty gritty aspects that really define the climate crisis and how REAL it is. Reading this article made this notion of the climate crisis being "real" very alarming to me. I know it may sound ridiculous to say that I feel more concerned after reading this article because I feel so close to the "impact zone" of the climate crisis (seeing as I literally live on an entire planet that is at risk), but I do feel more at risk. This article talks about Santa Barbara and Ventura county and it makes me nervous to think that the place I live in is at such risk for catastrophe and is not doing much to relieve this danger. I was especially angered/scared to know that many of the beach side residencies that I see every day will be gone in a number of years due to the erosion of the cliffside. Santa barbara pledged to due more to become environmentally conscious, but those empty promises are leading to its destruction. I am enticed to do more to preserve my college town for the sake of my peers and I, and I hope that others in the class feel the same way.

"Beyond the Limit" exposes just how proximate the climate crisis issue is in our lives. The article references news and stories from across the region surrounding UCSB, stretching from Ventura to Gaviota to even Isla Vista itself, UCSB's thriving home. Feeling the effects of the crisis from all directions is certainly alarming. While we are constantly under threat of severe fire (even in the Winter or Springtime), the tangible consequences of climate change are not limited to the soul-crushing catastrophes caused by natural disasters. Instead, "Beyond the Limit" truly conveys the sensation of a crisis creeping up from every direction. While we point our faces to the hills on fire only a few miles away, we turn our backs to the crumbling cliffs that threaten the structural integrity of our literal backyards. 
    <br><br>

Needless to say, this article is very alarming. Especially to residents living at the epicenter of the region being described. But while there is no question about the effectiveness of this article at raising the necessary concern, I still wonder whether such an article was even necessary. Did we really need proof that the climate crisis was affecting OUR lives to be able to mobilize? This issue is one of the reasons that the climate crisis has progressed so far already. Many parts of the world have already been feeling the effects of global warming for years, and many voices in the world have been attempting to cry out. The issue is that the areas in the world that have the most power have been the ones that are affected last. The article repeatedly emphasizes how wealthy the impacted areas are, mentioning the privilege of towns such as Montecito for no clear reason. A cynical reader might infer that the mentions of wealth are somehow supposed to suggest that these regions are most important or more worthy of rescue than others such as Paradise. While I don't think that was the intention of the article, I still think it's important to recognize that climate change has been an ongoing process for a long time now, and there have been many people trying to sound the alarm. It is unacceptable that we needed to reach this point to be called to action.

After reading the article “2°C: Beyond the Limit”, I am not entirely shocked by what I read; however, it was quite shocking to read that Del Playa would be eroded by 2060. 40 years from now. The place that we go to on Friday nights to have fun, will be nonexistent. 
     <br><br>

I was shocked to hear Ken mention the tornado warning in Santa Barbara that occurred just last month. If we cannot take a hint from the hundreds of others of destructive events occurring worldwide, I hope we can see that this is not just some fluke of nature, but a threat that WE caused. Furthermore, this is a threat that is NOT temporary. “Natural” disasters will continue to intensify as we continue to pollute our climate. 
     <br><br>

Although, I have to say, I am a little bit disappointed in the fact that no one really seemed to care about the destruction that climate change causes (and has been causing) until it begins to affect the affluent. In reality, the people who are suffering the most from climate change are the ones who are contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of people who are already burdened by poverty and oppression are given extraordinary challenges due to the impacts of climate change. Extreme weather events (like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico) undermine development gains and lead to further shortages in BASIC necessities such as food and water. Climate change has become a climate crisis, and people living in poverty have the most to lose. These people already struggle to earn a living, to feed their families, to create stable homes… and their struggle is made more difficult every day. I feel as though solutions that help vulnerable communities are often overlooked, and although climate change is discriminatory, our efforts to fight it cannot be.

As the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" and Ken both mention, California is known for its mild, Mediterranean climate with little seasonal variation in weather and predictable weather patterns. Due to this, the emergence of the effects of climate change in California have been more significantly noticed because (1) Californians are less prepared, both mentally and logistically, for drastic/bizarre weather changes and severe natural disasters, and (2) the fact that a place like California, which is known for its pleasant climate, is being so drastically affected by climate change is a big wake-up call for the rest of the country which already experiences harsher weather and large-scale natural disasters. 

     <br><br>

Having been a Californian all my life, this article was especially saddening because it made me realize that there is a good chance that weather/climate that I love and take for granted is rapidly and irreversibly changing for the worse. It also brings up an important point that I think many people, including myself, had not considered: because California plays such an important role in the food supply for our country, these climate changes could threaten our food security. This, along with many other reasons mentioned in the article, highlights why the rapidly changing climate in California is an immediate threat and that many of the effects of this change, including the major fires, are just the beginning of what is to come if we do not start creating and enforcing better solutions to this crisis right away.

After reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit", I started to think  about the causes for the climate crisis that is actually happening just around us.Not only this is a natural cycle, but also there is anthropogenic effects onto that.The outcomes of rise in the temperature is horrible, we could see the decrease in the animal populations, the disruptions of agriculture and people's daily life etc.2 Celsius increase in the temperature has become the bottom line, and is also the struggle that every human should make to protect the environment.There are also some adaptations people have made to meet with this environmental crisis.For example, farmers in Santa  Barbara used to plant staple food such as avocados, but later they began to grow some fruits that grow in hotter areas, such as dragon fruit, coffee
      <br><br>
However, the most shocking thing I have noticed in the reading is that,Santa Barbara has not reached the goal it has set to become a model for other cities and places to protect the environment.Even if the bureaus have set a series of rules, these rules were just words on the paper which had no sound  actions in reality.

After experiencing the mountain fire in Santa Barbara, I really feel that the abnormal climate phenomenon appear more frequently. The warmer environment, higher sea level, and more extinction, all of these things show the climate crisis. Just like the title of this article written by Scott Wilson, human beings only have 2-degree range to the extremity. According to the Washington post, “The coastal curve that bends south from Santa Barbara through the Los Angeles metroplex to the arroyos along the Mexican border is warming at double the rate of the continental United States” Just because this coastal curve in Santa Barbara is the place where I live beside, I get a deeper experience that the weather changed to drier, and windier, especially at the beach part. I think, we need to do something.

      <br><br>

But the reality is more “real” and disappointed. For most people including me, doing green things are “important but remote” just like saving refugees. Global warming and greenhouse gas almost become the life terms filled in peoples’ daily chat. They are unreachable. Maybe people get a little sense of danger and try very healthy and green diets and take public transportation for several days. Yet later, they would feel the diet is so boring and taking bus or walking are so inconvenient and tiring. Once I watched a lot of environmental documentaries, and the experts in it also mention this problem. It is quite hard to change people’s habits and diets in worldwide. But the more severe fire domain and the damage of housing make me feel stronger danger. Comparing to the invisible greenhouse gas, the terrible fire are more obvious, and show that the condition is worse at the same time. I really hope people can read this article and look how badly the fire damaged the whole country.

This hits home... literally. You hardly ever see articles talking about your own home, but this one does. When you read "Santa Barbara County '' or "Isla Vista" it makes you jerk up or pay more attention. I read every read and listened to every word because of this. It's hard to imagine what climate change is doing to your home until you actually see or hear someone else give you hard facts and statistics about it. Knowing that Ventura is the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states is horrendous. That is literally our neighbor, so you know if they are warming up the fastest, we must be right there with them. The article states that Santa Barbara has reached 115 degree weather in the summertime. To me, that's nothing compared to my hometown. My hometown will reach 120+ degrees multiple times throughout the weeks of summer. The thing is, my family would always travel out of town to get away from the heat, a place like Santa Barbara where it is known to have the "perfect" weather all summer. The thing is, now everywhere is starting to warm up just like it does in my hometown, unless we do something about it.

Today was cloudy. I felt a bit lethargic because it was cold and gray. I wondered if I’d miss the cold and gloomy weather in the future. 
      <br><br>

The article started by describing how Terri Bowman is used to fire. It’s interesting to note that we’re also slowly getting used to the slight degree of heating. We usually don’t notice much. If we complain a bit, sweat and hydrate more, crank up the A.C., it’ll be fine. Reading the article reminds me that other species are being affected by just 1.8 degrees worldwide. Coral is a well-known example, but I was shocked to find that even redwood forests and Joshua trees are affected. I feel that, compared to many others, I know a bit about the effects of climate change, but I still forgot that, among living beings, plants, not crops or animals, would also be affected. It reminds me of how climate change will affect the entire planet, but people often forgot just how much climate change will do. Climate change is just so big of a concept that it’s extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, for everyone to completely or decently grasp and remember. There are so many effects and causes that effects that seem small but aren’t and simple yet solvable root causes are forgotten.
      <br><br>

 I had no idea Santa Barbara was known as “the birthplace of the modern environmental movement.” Until about now, I only knew it was a tourism spot or something. Yesterday, I even had someone tell me that Santa Barbara doesn’t recycle because it’s not worth the cost. 
      <br><br>

Although I didn’t know Santa Barbara was known for the environmental movement, I have known that its cliffs are crumbling ever since I arrived last year. A friend told me about it, and I even directly saw it once. I was doing homework at the beach under the cliffs, and I saw a bit of the cliff, like a few chunks, fall down about a foot away from a couple of girls who proceeded to scream and run away from the cliff. That day, I also saw the tides rise and cover the beach. The beach came back with low tide, but someday it might not, which is saddening.
      <br><br>

I saw a pumpjack every day when growing up. As a child, I didn’t know what that weird thing was doing. It was just fun to watch as I sat in the car on the way to elementary school. I didn’t even know what they were until I read the article. In middle school, we were called “junior oilers,” and the mascot was an oil derrick. Just now, I found out from a recent LA Times article that a Superfund site, created from oil drilling and a landfill, existed right next to the park I used to take tennis lessons at when I was a kid. If the LA Time article is true, then they’ve only just now, in January, started to clean it up. Even better, the Superfund site is right next to a high school. Ignorance is bliss, until they start to clean up a Superfund site next to your high school.

It’s depressing how much we don’t know or won’t know until it’s too late. That poor vintner tried preventing fire from threatening his ranch, but nope. Everything he did was useless because it was too late. He was acting to prevent fire damages, but was actually reacting too late to climate change’s effects.

I have read many comments, and I can see a lot of you are saying things like, "ha, we got work on protecting our environment." Your wordings might be different, but I can tell you mean the same thing. Let's just ignore how broad this kind of statement is and discuss this topic itself, "Protecting Environment." Does the environment really need us to protect it? I ask this because to the earth itself, there are no much differences between whether the weather is too cold or too warm. The one who defines the conditions of the environment is actually us, human. Therefore, when we refer to "protecting environment," what we are really referring to is "protecting us from the environment that can damage us." No one wants to lower the temperature just because it's too high; we want to make it lower because it's damaging our living spaces.
      <br><br>
We care about wildfire because there are houses burned, animals killed, and pollution emitted. Yes, the primary cause of fires is global warming, I agree. Then, what can you do about it? Can you ask everyone not to drive a car for years? Nope. Can you stop the countries from developing their factories? Nope and states cannot even stop themselves actually. Can you stop eating meat and stop making trash? No. I mean, honestly, you can do nothing besides feeling sorry for someone suffered and continuing doing what you do. Even if you believe you have the ability to do what I have asked, the goal of lowering down the environment cannot be accomplished in at least half-century. How many houses and forests will be burned in this half-century? Many many.

So, besides saying "protecting environments" in such a broad way, why don't we say ourselves first. For example, instead of building houses in wood, let's create our homes in stone and cement. At least, we make sure our houses won't be burned if made in such structures. After that, let's make the cities more civilized and make the fire station more distributive; once there is wildfire happened, all fire stations detect it can go for it at the same time. After we can make sure no one will be hurt by gradually completing the first two steps, we can now move our eyes to bring down the temperature. There are many ways to do it, and it's a slow process, like I said, taking at least half-century. AND, probably, global warming is already solved after we have done the first two steps I have said.

The reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" shows me a delicate world which largely affected by human beings from the climate change. In fact, a lot of phenomenon happened around us these years. Such as the wildfire happened in Santa Barbara last few months, California is suffering wildfires every year. This is a serious effect of climate change. I believe everyone thought this is a serious problem, but no one really pay attention on how to figure out the problem, unless the climate change has physically affected one's life. Fires endanger wildlife, plants, lands and cause large damage to the environment and ecosystem. Except for fires, the world is experiencing global warming. According to the article, I am surprised that the annual temperature change has been raised 2.6 celsius from 100 years ago, and the global temperature is still raising right now. Data and graphs in the article want to remind readers to look at the overall world and protect it from more damage of climate change. A lot of resources were used in the past to create energy, at the same time, they produced large amount of wastes like carbon dioxide. They are stored in the air, in the ground and cannot be decomposed. 
      <br><br>
The article also expresses that "We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” It makes me think about ourselves. Making a change always needs some efforts and costs. To us, we have to cost something to make an approach to the climate change. Any tiny improvements are good starts.

The article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" focuses on the town that we are currently living in, Santa Barbara. This is a beautiful city near the beach that is why many of us chose to attend to the school of UCSB. We had no idea that some day we would be face with many environmental crisis. It is winter in right now and the weather makes it seem like we are in spring right now. This provides that temperature has been rising in this city. The average temperature has heated up by 2.3 degrees celsius that is astonishing. Climate change is affecting our home we have near been this close to it. It is hard to believe that we will not only be affected by sea level rising since we are close to the coast but also by high temperatures. In this town we were affect by a wild fire not that long along. I could see the fires from my dorm window and every hour that I would look at it, the fire seemed like if it was getting closer and closer to campus. The classes had to get cancelled due to the bad air quality. This makes me thing that if we continue to let this happen we will no longer be able to energy our beautiful town due to the high temperatures and air quality. Wild fires like the one most of us witness will be common very often that will be not feel alarmed by them. It is crazy to believe that we are the school that is doing the most for our enviroment yet we are one of the cities to be warming up the most. We are not doing enough as a school to help control climate change. We should educate the citizens of Santa Barbara about climate change and all the consequences that come out it so they can be aware and act fast towards controlling it. Every action counts and lets us stand and protect our marine life and our beautiful city.

I completely agree with your comment. I find it terrifying to know that a beautiful place, a place where many of us at UCSB call our home, can be in serious danger due to the negative effects caused by climate change. I’ve heard about various places in California getting hotter every year and extreme fires burning down people’s homes, but after seeming the fires so close to campus in November and reading this article, it worried me even more as it hits so close to home. I agree with you that we are all not doing enough. In order for there to be a change everyone must work together to do all they possibly can to prevent our beautiful home and the creatures that live here from getting ruined.

"2ºC: Beyond the Limit" is effective in displaying the urgency of the current situation with climate change. No longer is the problem in some fa away country, it is now within our own counties and cities. Living in Southern California for my whole life, I could relate to the article in the fact that there have also been fires so close to my home that the ashes of the fire could be seen falling from the sky. The article shows that the effects of climate change are already greatly affecting the daily lives of those living in the SB/ Ventura area.

It is most concerning that Santa Barbara makes no attempts to reach the goals that it exclaims. This is not surprising, however, as most people don't take responsibilities in their actions, as they feel their contribution to climate change is insignificant. It is unfortunate to see that not even a climate change proactive city would fight against climate change; much less likely a big corporation would take initiative.

As a student now living in Santa Barbara, I became more aware about the issue on climate change and how relatively close I am to potential hotspots for fires to emerge. It’s definitely worrisome to not know what to expect from the impacts of climate change. All we know is that it’s here and the impacts of it are just going to get far worse than anything else we have ever seen. The article 2°C: Beyond the limit, introduces the major consequences of climate change and the effects it has already has had on cities like Santa Barbara and Ventura county. I was extremely surprised to find out Ventura is the most fast-warming counties within California, and perhaps it’s only going to get warmer from there. Many don’t see much harm in an increase of temperature by just a few degrees, it’s frustrating that many of them don’t see the harmful effects of this. Especially with a rising sea level just eroding at cliffs poses such a threat for people living in communities such as Isla Vista and Del Playa. This article mentions that perhaps climate change will not affect people right now or when they are older, but new generations will have to pay the consequences for something that these older generations have created. It’s a warning for us individuals to start doing something about this crisis before it increasingly gets worse.

I entered this course uneducated about climate change and its future impact across the globe. After reading "2ºC: Beyond the Limit", I am now more aware of the outcomes and how close to home it hits. I had no idea beautiful Santa Barbara was being affected the way it is. The increase may only be 2 degrees, but that will surely keep increasing as climate changes continues to unravel due to our negligence of our precious earth. It was heartbreaking to see homes on the cliffs needing support of pillars to prevent any collapses right down the street from me. Those homes will eventually be gone and we are losing hope to change that. We all express our concerns for our planet but never enough to make some crucial changes to our day to day life. To read Ventura being the fastest warming county in California was mind-blowing. Our incredible state of California is deteriorating and it's more alarming than ever.

The most frightening thing to learn from this article is how imminent this threat is and that natural disasters are likely to get worse within my time here at UCSB. I hate to admit I've been pretty ignorant for assuming that the issues of fires and droughts really won’t affect me. But now it has me questioning if I am prepared for such an emergency. What will I do with all my belongings? If evacuation is necessary, what’s most important for me to take? Should I prepare an emergency kit? It was also disheartening to see Santa Barbara being hypocritical. It is saddening that Santa Barbara fell away from its goals due to personal interests rather than the good of the overall community. Santa Barbara policymakers need to do more at a more effective pace to reduce its emissions and make the change to renewable energy.

Perhaps The Uninhabitable Earth does indeed paint a global picture about the potential consequences of climate change in a pessimistic way, however 2 °C: Beyond the Limit just makes those “unlikely events” even more probable by telling us how the climate change has already severely impacted many, many lives—just like you and me, right here around Santa Barbara. As the air gets drier and drier along the coast due to the warming of the ocean, water reserve declines rapidly. The farmers are no longer able to plant water-intensive plants like avocado anymore. The sea level is rising and it is eating away the cliffs and coasts. The rate of wildfires is increasing, and people are either worried about the potential fire, setting up equipment for putting out the fire when in reality the power outage will render them useless, or forced to move out of their burned homes. This series of unfortunate events as a result of climate change has affected hundreds of thousands of people here in this region—and it could soon happen to you and me. This article is no longer a cautionary tale, but a reality check. The need for action is now.
        <br><br>
 “This is even worse than I thought.” The fact that this article still makes me think this way even after reading all those other articles on climate change really tells me about just how much I don’t know about climate change, and how much the media has failed to report on such a serious issue with much emphasis. People aren’t reminded on the news that these disasters happen because of climate change. If I see these news on TV, I would see them as something unfortunate rather than something caused by man-made climate change; I would see them as a local problem rather than something that would potentially affect me. Why do I have to read these lengthy articles to know that these wildfires and droughts are not normal?

The fact that warming in California has already exceeded the 2015 climate accord limit set by Obama is astounding. I am a native Northern Californian. I lived in the east bay and the north bay. I have visited Southern California multiple times because most of my family lives down here and I've always believed that this part of California is dry and more prone to fires than northern California. Learning about the fires that have occurred in Santa Barbara county hasn't surprised me, but has showed me that it is more common throughout different environments than I thought. Throughout the past few years in northern California, my school has been cancelled for multiple weeks for different reasons including flooding and fires. I used to think this was just an anomaly completely unrelated to climate change, however, seeing that these same problems are happening all over California worries me. People often think of northern California as more green and less prone to fires, but the fact that where I'm from has at least as many natural disasters as Santa Barbara county which is one of the counties that has the highest growth in temperature rise worries me.

In "Before The Flood" with Leonardo Dicaprio, as he goes to India, they talk about how the United States needs to be a representative example of how climate change needs to be fixed. However, in the United States especially California, the Climate change epidemic is becoming worse than anywhere else in the world. The article we just read shows me that the United States is definitely not becoming a good example to the rest of the world.

        <br><br>

The fact that fire safety is becoming very common in southern California is worrying as I've mentioned before,  we are becoming used to the fact that climate change is directly affecting our lives.

Wake up in the morning, and smell the crisp and fresh smell of smoke from the monthly - or is it biweekly now? - wildfire. Look towards the nice beautiful orange sunrise - except it's 11:00 AM, the sun's well on it's way to the peak, and the sun doesn't rise in the north. Feel the refreshingly dry air blowing on the breeze, just the same as it's been for months. Rejoice, as you bike down the streets and look for bike parking that isn't there - don't worry, though, there's always room for another parking garage. Smile, because you get to enjoy another day where your politicians made a difference and committed to fighting climate change - but hold on a second, they can't afford to hurt your bottom line. 
        <br><br>

Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

The article, “2 degree Celsius: beyond the limit” shows that the temperature goes up a lot and this leads to a lot of problems like the wildfire and ocean level rise. People living in California are facing this huge problems. Professor gave one personal story of tornado comes which is pretty scary. The increasingly high frequency of tornado and wildfire are the result of climate crisis. The impacts of the climate crisis is no longer the ocean rise and it will not only influence the people who live near the coastline but also people around the world. It will be harmful to everyone. So what should we do? We should not observe on the sideline any more, we must take some actions for us and our next generations.

This article really hit home for me because my family has experienced the effects of climate change in Ventura County. St. Thomas Aquinas College, where the Thomas Fire started, is where my aunt and uncle live. My uncle is the president of the college and it was a terrifying time for our family when this fire began. My aunt got injured during the evacuation, but they made it out safely along with my cousins living in the Ojai valley. Having a personal connection to this article really made it sink in. The increasing fire patterns and severity are a very real danger that could affect any one of us at any time. We can no longer predict normal fire behavior and cycles because the problem of wildfire in California has been so exacerbated.

The article "2 degrees beyond the limit" brings to my attention specific scenarios in which climate change induced natural disaster has affected the county. It is an astonishing fact that 3 of the most severe fires - The Sherpa, Thomas and Cape fires - happened in just the last two years. It has taken their own backyards to burn before real activism takes place. However, even then it is hard to convince people to give up their daily conveniences in the face of existential threats. Convenient parking is a primary concern of Santa Barbara county officials, which is truly telling of the county's attitude towards climate change. How astonishing; It will truly take the burning of their establishments before the concern for parking is extinguished. In 2015 Santa Barbara was 14% above emissions from 2007 when their goal was the be 15% BELOW those emissions.

Oil industries can still lobby their way into the coastal oil reserves. While that sum of money could change the lives of many third world peoples, there are tragically those in power that feel that they're important enough to be in ownership of it all. Individuals incapable of doing their job correctly feel that it is money well earned. 
        <br><br>

Another consequence is the migration of many people to places like San Diego. A large influx of people which ultimately leads to more pollution. More congestion, consumption, wastefulness in this new, concentrated region. People are simply unwilling to give up their usual way of life. Part of the problem is the fallacy characterized by unwillingness to take action due to the assumption that others will (or wont and their efforts will feel somehow for not). Of course, we know logically that the solution is to simply do what needs to be done.

In this article “2C: Beyond the Limit” by Scott Wilson it clearly demonstrates the fact that climate change is right around the corner. As a fellow gaucho I was incredibly surprised when I found out that Ventura  is the “fastest warming county.” The fact that Santa Barbara county has risen 2 degrees in such a short period of time is a wake up call to us living here. I've always been pro-saving the environment my entire life but up until recently I never really did anything to contribute to operation: save the planet. I took it upon myself to change bad habits such as leaving running water on, leaving lights on, using paper over plastic etc. We all can talk the talk but can we walk the walk? The increase in the rate of fires in Santa Barbara is primarily caused by a rise in temperature and climate change in general. It's pretty scary to think about how corporations across the world can ultimately cause a fire that destroys your livelihood or a flood that ultimately ends up engulfing you. There is some hope, in  Santa Barbara at least, there has been a major switch towards compostable items, much more recycling, and less carbon footprint in general. I'll do my best in order to prevent and would hope my fellow gauchos do the same.

started taking this course. It is hard to not see the effects of the climbing temperatures when you live and go to school in the area that is being hit the hardest. Hearing that “remedies are largely ineffective,” was not the most reassuring news. I want to hear how an individual can help. I want to hear that there will be a happy ending. I want to know that my home will be safe.  It makes me sad that Santa Barbara’s own beauty can be a reason for its demise. Everyone wants a look. Everyone wants to live here. But with that comes consequences. A few weeks ago I heard a story that a man bought all the homes lining Sabado Tarde, one street back from the beachside street, Del Playa, with homes perched on the crumbling cliffs. When asked why he bought all of that property, he said that in 20 years, it will be the new coastline. My eyebrows lifted. A smart investment, sure, but a crazy thing to envision. 

        <br><br>

To live in fear that your home may be engulfed in flames with a box of valuables seems like cause to move to a safer area. Surprisingly people don’t leave this area. Despite the fires, mudslides, and drought, California still holds the glory and lifestyle that many desire. I have certainly given my future a deeper thought as to where I will settle down and it will not be in California. I can sacrifice beauty for cheaper living and a safer future.

After reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit", I feel kind of sad and kind of angry. It was surprised that Ventura was the fastest warming county in California. It is so close to the Santa Barbara where I'm living in right now. Santa Barbara is beautiful but it is still suffering from pollution and warming. The mountain fire last year was so horrible. We must take some actions to protect the environment.

Interestingly enough, I believe the article addressed a common problem in modern day activism, not just in regards to climate change but the world in general. So much of this generation, myself included, are given a plethora of information regarding the terrible things that are/will happen to the world but take almost zero action into actually addressing the issues. So many of my peers are just as wary of the impending climate change as I am, yet none of us have actually taken any action into fixing it(until now). I do appreciate the fact that the author of this article visits this issue frequently, talking about how citizens aren't willing to give up their free parking for the sake of the climate. Human beings naturally act as if they really care about an issue until they have to face the repercussions of actually doing anything about it. 
        <br><br>
All of this is why I appreciate the choice in reading for this week.  Because it addresses problems in our very own city, I hope it gives more incentive for us to actually stand up and make action.  I feel like the problem stated above is only a major issue because people aren't fully aware of all the terrible things that may happen as a result. As stated in the article, this is affecting some of the wealthiest people in the county, not just those that are already struggling.

After reading the article “2°C: Beyond the Limit”. I felt terrible. The fire do have a lot of negative influence on people’s life and the environment: acreage burned, home destroyed and the live lost. Although the scientist thought that it is fine that the temperature rises at 1°C, however, the temperature is already warm more than 1°C. Also, the fire has negative effect on offshore which many species dead without foods. People have to leave from their home, and it costs government a lot of money to rebuild the infrastructures. The cause of this climate change is urbanization which nowadays have more and more traffics. I think that people could take more public transportation instead of driving outside. This could improve the traffic problem.  And the reading claims the “global weirding” which farmers fail to harvest these day. The scientists try to find a way to use less water to help those crop alive. So, hope one day scientist could find the method to use less water. Santa Barbara is so beautiful but with the temperatures become warmer and warmer, the sea level rises which cause the cliff. Since the cliff, many families lose their home and have to leave. I hope the climate could not change so rapidly and hope Santa Barbara would not be damage.

2°C: Beyond the limit was an eyeopener, which shows us the dangers in Santa Barabra. The climate crisis is really happening and the effects will not only harm us but the future. It was sad to find out that in a few years Del Playa will no longer be the same. I personally never knew about the dangers in Santa Barbara and had no clue about erosion, oil spills, wildfires and etc. I honestly chose this school for the nice view and the beach. I never encountered any of the natural events. I come from Orange County and would visit the beach and never had any issues with tar, and I never heard about wildfires. This is my first year and when my mom found out about the recent one in November, she freaked out and thought we had been evacuated. It’s crazy to think that there are fires going on near the beach, when you imagine a wildfire its usually in the forest, far away from people. In the article, they also show how people have to change their lifestyles to accommodate the crisis we’re going through. For example, farmers have to stop producing avocados since they require a large amount of water and have changed into agave and exotic fruits, which doesn’t require a large quantity of water.

I am a Ventura County native; I've lived in the county my whole life, and even as I transitioned to college, I stayed within range; just as far as the neighboring county. When I talk about my hometown of Oxnard, California, I never fail to mention that the weather is perfect: "never too hot and never too cold," is my typical motto. However, as I've grown up and become aware of the environmental calamities of our time, I am just now awakening to the reality that the weather here isn't as ideal as it once was. ClimiteCrisis101, along with the lectures, films and articles such as 2 degrees Celsius: Beyond the Limit, are full of information that I was completely oblivious to. Just this past week I learned the harsh reality: I live in the fastest warming area out of all the other counties in the "lower forty-eight states." While I first considered this fact mind-blowing, taking a step back, I can now fathom just how impactful a mere 2.6 degrees Celsius can be, it was just something that I never really put into perspective. Things have changed, I have seen the effects of my county's climate change first-hand. School got cancelled for almost two weeks in November/December for the past two years in a row, it is trend that was once unheard of, never part of the schedule. Now, wearing air masks around that time is just something us Ventura County residents have become accustomed to, fire season seems to be here to stay. I am now aware that I have no bragging rights to describe my hometown as having the "perfect weather" and the reality is that "perfect weather" may not be attainable because of our active contamination of our homeland.

Wilson’s article about the Santa Barbara county evokes a more grim feeling within me, as it likely does for a good number of UCSB students, due to how much closer it hits home. Climate change is a world away to me, a force that I can’t even see. Even with the destructive Paradise Fire just over a year ago in California being dangerously close, I always reassured myself that I would never be forced to face the effects of climate change and that I could hide away from it. But as seen by recent events mentioned in both the article and the video accompanying it, that is not the case. Sooner or later, the landscape around Santa Barbara will become unrecognizable due to rising sea levels. When the land is facing the risk of being swept away, the proper reaction would be to take countermeasures to prevent this threat (i.e. mitigating our contribution to climate change), and yet, as seen in Wilson’s article, we have done the exact opposite by feeding the process that will engulf Santa Barbara. If this does not get the people in power to take action, then what will?

“2°C: Beyond the limit” is an article explaining the effects of climate change in our local community. Hearing about climate change and studying its effects is one thing, but I have never been so personally connected to it until I read this article. People often can't relate to its issues unless they are involved in them. But climate change is real and its affecting our school and home. It is not a distant threat. For an example, Isla Vista housing is known for its beautiful view, but it might be all gone by 2060 due to erosion caused by high sea levels and crashing waves along the cliffs. Neighboring Santa Barbara is Ventura county, who has an average increase in temperature by 2.6 degrees Celsius, and is ranked the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states. These concerning problems put the global issue into perspective. Its disturbing facts are due to climate change and its happening close to home at an alarming rate.

As a student at UCSB, this article opened my eyes about the inaction taking place in Santa Barbara against the consequences of climate change. Although Santa Barbara is often pinpointed as the home of the environmental movement, it is evident that our town is not taking enough action to protect not only our city, but our whole planet. For example, the article pointed out that Santa Barbara failed to reduce its GHG emissions by 15% in 2015 compared to its 2007 levels. Rather than lowering GHG the levels, we raised the levels to 14% above the GHG levels in 2007. Additionally, the article also stated that IV’s famous Del Playa may no longer exist within a few decades. With wild fires burning out mountains, rising temperatures affecting our climate, and an increase in GHG emissions, what will it take for the our residents to take action against climate change? The demographics of SB indicate that many of the residents are educated and typically support measures supporting the environment. Therefore, what else must be done before it is too late? As a city that is at the foreground of environmental breakthroughs, we must set a high standard for what it means to be environmentally conscious.

The article “2°C: Beyond The Limit” really demonstrates just how much california is being affected by the climate crisis. The fact that Ventura is ranked as the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states is unbelievable to me because it is so close to Santa Barbara. It is very worrisome that the warming has already surpassed the threshold that was set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. This agreement was set to try to control global warming and try to keep it well below under 2°C in order to try to prevent catastrophes. If this was put in place to prevent catastrophic disasters, then why on earth would Trump want to leave. People on the coasts are fearful of sea level rise and in California civilians are scared of fires and sea level rise and our president decides the best thing to do is to pull OUT of a climate change prevention agreement? Our redwood forest and joshua trees are being put at stake as the temperature continues to grow and our president dosen't seem to care that these treasures along with others are being put in jeopardy due to his lousy decisions.

It’s disappointing that something as horrific as the Thomas Fire has to happen to get attention for the climate crisis argument. It is glaringly obvious that our climate is changing at a rapid rate and affecting all of our communities. In California fire season is now year round. Having lived in California all my life, it is honestly so depressing to constantly hear about people who live in the same state as you being evacuated so often- sometimes it’s only a few towns over, sometimes it’s a few hours away- but this is the state in which i reside and it makes these fires even more terrifying. A big contributor to these fires is the rise in temperature and it is frustrating to feel like my entire state is heating up and burning down and knowing that it is virtually impossible for me to do anything about it besides try to fight the climate crisis by recycling and eating differently. Many people think of global warming as something far off and not directly affecting them, but it’s hard to be that naive when everyday we are hearing about a new city on fire or a new town flooding. We cannot ignore the obvious anymore: climate change is real and we are doing far too little to combat it.

Reading about all of the effects that the climate crisis has caused so near to where I now live has been eye-opening. Before reading, I had not given thought to the fact that after walking on the beach I would have tar on my feet. I thought this was just a strange feature of beaches here and did not realize that this was actually from an oil rig blowout in 1969. This tar is also an example of just how far-reaching the effects of the climate crisis will be. Even if we were to take action now, impacts from actions we have already taken will last for at least 50 years. It is also strange to think of how the geography of this area could be fundamentally altered in a short amount of time. The bluffs where many apartments sit could be eroded by 78% by 2060 and those places would become unlivable. 

        <br><br>

It is extremely terrifying that so many things around me are directly affected by the climate crisis and will continue to be affected for decades if not centuries. It is likely that in the future fires will increase, more land will erode, crops will have to be changed, marine life will be harmed, and many more consequences will occur that we might not even be able to predict now. It is extremely disheartening that even though these effects are real and happening now, even people who believe that climate change is harmful and needs to be stopped are unwilling to change their behavior to stop it. Indeed, making significant progress against climate change will probably cost money and cause slight inconveniences such as reduced parking. However, those seem like small sacrifices compared to the devastating results if no action is taken. Yet, people still refuse to act. I hope that seeing the repercussions of climate change will soon shake people out of their apathy.

I fell in love with UCSB from the moment I was handed a brochure as a freshman in high school. I knew from that moment that I wanted to attend this University, for it offered a great education along with serene ocean views and perfect weather. That changed all too quickly when I arrived here as a freshman and took my first trip to the beach. I was ready to make this the first of many trips to the beach until I stepped into an unfamiliar smelly substance, Tar. I asked around as to why there was so much tar on the beach, and my barber told me that there was a huge oil spill a few decades back. This article covers that spillage and emphasizes the notion that Santa Barbara county has promised to join the climate movement by reducing our carbon footprint, I wonder how on earth it plans on doing that when we have oil rigs continuing to dig up fossil fuels as I type this comment. Santa Barbara and Ventura county should be worried now more than ever as we have experienced a temperature increase of 2.3 degrees Celsius. Our beloved Del playa is in danger of being nothing but an legend we tell our grandchildren as sea levels rise causing the cliffs to erode faster than ever. Fires like the Thomas fire are taking innocent lives, for 23 people lost their lives in Montecito caused by mudslides following the events of the fire. It’s disappointing to say the least, that our county which is suffering the most, is going against their word and instead of reducing our carbon footprint, we have increased carbon emissions by 14 percent since 2007. Our county needs to practice what they preach. Nothing is worse than a hypocrite and sadly our county is just that.

The article taught me a lot about Santa Barbara and the surrounding area that I wasn’t aware of. I was really surprised to learn that neighboring Ventura County is the fastest-warming county in the Lower 48 states, and that both Santa Barbara and Ventura have warmed more than 2 degrees celsius since 1895 - which is exceeding the threshold warned by the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. I was also surprised to learn that the 2017 Thomas Fire was the largest in state history at the time, and I also had no idea that it killed 23 people. Sometimes I forget how these fires really threaten people’s lives and homes, and that it’s not always an easy evacuation or something that can be recovered from. Learning that the Thomas Fire killed 23 people really made me realize the danger and urgency of this wildfire situation. 
        <br><br>

I’m not surprised that Santa Barbara is warming quickly, given the information the article discussed, such as the fact that the Climate Action Plan doesn’t impose any mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals. Also, the interests of the oil industry are still prevalent and causing consequences. I can see what the article is saying about Santa Barbara as a city being a sort of hypocrite in regards to the environment. Yes, there has been much environmental activism here, but at the same time there is little enforcement, strong competing interests like the oil companies and private businesses, and citizens who would like to continue having free public parking for their cars.
        <br><br>

In all, it’s interesting to experience the Santa Barbara environment and climate firsthand as someone who just moved here from out of state. I had never seen a wildfire up close until last quarter, and we really do see the erosion on the bluffs every time we walk down Del Playa. It will be interesting to see how the environment will change over the next few years, and I hope to become more involved in change as a resident of Santa Barbara now.

It is crazy to me that Santa Barbara County where most of us now call our home is the fastest-warming county in the lower forty eight states in the USA. Without even knowing this place is slowly eroding and we need to change that. Isla Vista is known for having high cliffs and the view is beautiful but never did I think that most of Isla Vista by 2060 might be gone due to high sea levels and the waves crashing alongside the cliffs creating massive erosion. Santa Barbara is a place we not only call our home but also a place where great knowledge is spread. If this place where to be damaged one day by a natural disaster many of us will suffer drastically. We will not only lose our home but also our source of education as UCSB may no longer exist, future generations will no longer be able to experience some of the best times living in Santa Barbara and that is just devastating. Hopefully, it never reaches to this extent but people do need to start acting and caring more about our environment by being more cautious of their everyday actions.  
        <br><br>

In addition to this Santa Barbara is also the leading county for harvesting and producing nuts and fruits to most of the United States. Therefore many people rely on their produce coming from Santa Barbara but due to an increase in temperature and the danger of drought, many farmers are having a hard time producing fruits that require lots of water. Instead many farmers now need to accommodate to the changing temperatures and harvest fruits that don't require much water or sun such as avocados. The climate change is not only affecting farmers and their jobs but many people all across the world.

I think that it is a really good idea for people to become well-versed in the local effects that will take place in their cities and towns with climate change. When discussing global warming, we so often talk about issues so far away and almost irrelevant to our daily lives, i.e. the poles melting or the Amazon burning. While both of these issues are severe and threaten human lives in complicated ways, I think it is hard for people to truly get scared about things they can't see or even really imagine. Most of us have never been to the Amazon, so we don't know how we would feel to see it in flames. However when we talk about our homes - the places we have friends and family, where we study and excercise and eat and shop and live... suddenly climate change is no longer a distant threat. The IV cliffs falling into the ocean is a very real image that cements the harsh reality of the climate crisis.

Climate change never felt so personal until I read this article. It’s one thing to hear about events throughout our planet that are being cause by climate change, but it’s another to have actually experienced these events for yourself. Because this article focused mostly on the ventura county and santa barbara, I actually witnessed some of the events discussed throughout it, as I have lived in santa barbara for the past two years. In the past, when I thought of climate change, I thought of the major impacts it was having on our planet, such as things I would hear about on the news or through social media. However, this article made me realize that evidence of climate change has happened right before my own eyes, literally. The multiple forest fires I’ve witnessed throughout my short time here in santa barbara, along with the tornado warning in late December that was brought up in this video, are all events I was not expecting to be issues I would encounter while here. But why would I have been expecting events such as these to occur? These types of events aren’t necessarily related to santa barbara, or even just california in general. I had never received a tornado warning in my life before just a couple of weeks ago. Back then I wasn’t enrolled in this class, and didn’t have the knowledge on climate crisis then that I do now. Climate change definitely feels more real when I think about events such as these, as well as from reading this article that focuses on a place I am so familiar with, but now have a completely different understanding on it after reading.

After reading and analyzing Scott Wilson's "2°C: Beyond the Limit," I found the article to be fascinating and devastating because it provides an in-depth analysis of the effects of climate change on our local community. The fact that erosion, as result of climate change, is affecting homes on the cliffs of Isla Vista really helps puts the global issue into perspective. Similarly, the terrible fires that have plagued and damaged California has established itself as the top threat to humanity. Seeing natural catastrophes occur so close to home really drives the point through. The reality is that climate change has already begun and will continue, causing more natural disasters to occur at an even greater speed and magnitude. Unless humans collectively begin engaging and utilizing superior, environment-friendly energies and activities, more people will lose their homes, their livelihoods, and their lives.

The most astonishing part for me of all these facts is that Santa Barbara’s anti-pollution goals, serve as a model for others to follow, fail. I fell in love with Santa Barbara since the day I came for the first time. The fabulous scenery of the sea and California sunshine drew me into a helpless situation and can’t get out. This is such a nice place to study and enjoy life, and thus I’m tired to hear that redwood forests, desert habitats and kelp forests offshore are all being destroyed, and the number of cutie whales washed ashore will keep increasing. The mountain fire of last quarter made me excited at first because of class cancellation and feeling of freshness; however, I soon realized that the continuous mountain fire is such a terrible signal. My consciousness is deepened by “2°C: Beyond the limit.” Last year’s fire, together with Thomas Fire in 2017, is both the extreme consequences that happen so close to us, unexpectedly. 
        <br><br>

Just as Ken mentioned in the video, climate change will create consequences like tornados that may well be altogether unexpected. These are the events that can’t be reached out by computer models. Besides, this means not only physical consequences but also human implications are taken into account. For example, food supply and security for the US will be threatened. Here comes to a continual and never-answered problem: the concern is not that people have no ideas about the climate crisis; the main focus is people’s nonfeasance, silence, and sense of “unexpected.”

What amazes me is how such a perceptive and conscientious species such as humanity can ignore such stark changes on our planet. Things are changing. Drastically. And yet, people still find every excuse, every distraction, to turn away from the issues pressing mankind and our collective future. Fires in the amazon, freezing in Florida, storm after storm, fire after fire; Mother Nature has been hurting and henceforth hurling all of these things at mankind but we can still ignore it! It baffles me, but I understand how feeling small can affect one’s perception on their personal part in the climate crisis. In the article "2 degrees Celsius: Beyond the Limit", what caught my attention was the mention of the numerous issues the climate crisis has brought down upon this area and the surrounding counties. As one of the areas with the fastest recorded warming in the US, Santa Barbara and Ventura county are facing drastic changes. The loss of coastline, loss of crops, drought, tornadoes, heat waves, and raging fires are just some of the issues we are now facing.
        <br><br>

What shocks me is that while some of these issues are becoming concerning to many of the county’s inhabitants, they are often not connected to climate change necessarily, and many peoples’ first thoughts are on how to mitigate the immediate issues coming this way, and not how to prevent further climate change. Santa Barbara is happy where it’s at now, and is not willing to look to the unknown  for a cleaner and greener community, it seems, for fear of giving up what they already have, but what we don’t realize is that all of that will be lost if we cannot mitigate and slow climate change. It may be hard to feel like your say makes a big difference in such an immense issue, but we need everyone’s attention and action to collectively make a change. I hope that people in Santa Barbara county will begin to walk their talk and make a change.

Interestingly, the thing that stuck out to me most in this article was the part about the free parking. It made me think about how I am personally affecting the environment and how my everyday choices - although I may not realize it - make an impact on the environment. Everytime I drive I rely on free parking for convenience. When there isn’t anywhere free to park, or any parking at all (even with a cost) I become upset, but I never really realized how selfish and silly I am being. I am upset because I am inconvenienced, but in the long run when the world is dying, that is such a bigger inconvenience. I put my personal leisure as a priority, but in doing so, I am making a negative impact without even thinking about it. Never have I thought that my convenient free parking is acting as a hindrance against the fight against climate change.  I know that was a really minor thing that was briefly mentioned in the article but it really made me think, and it made me relate to the quote that says, “Santa Barbara is often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives.” I always say I care about the environment, but what do I really know about climate change? Almost nothing. I always want to put myself first because I did not really have a great understanding about what was going on. I feel like this can relate to not only me and Santa Barbara, but for people everywhere. There are so many people that say that they want to make a change because that is what everyone else is doing, but they don’t really know what it takes.

        <br><br>

Additionally, and semi-unrelated, I never really thought of myself being affected by climate change. I always heard that ice caps were melting, but what did that mean for me? Now I have a better understanding that this is not something that is just affecting “other” places, but it’s right here in my own backyard. A tornado warning in Santa Barbara is terrifying, and all these fires occurring are terrible. I never thought that such things could hit so close to home, but now they’re coming closer and closer, and soon these strange happenings will be the norm.

The main thing that I took from this article is that Santa Barbara county loves to talk more than act. I was under the impression that Santa Barbara county was a huge activist in this climate change issue. While there is a massive movement and large amounts of people that are dedicated towards this issue, the leaders and officials of the county are not doing enough. At this point they should just stop trying to act as if they care because it just makes the county look bad. For example, the article mentions that in 2015 Santa Barbara County pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent compared with the levels of 2007, but it was found just two years later that the county was actually doing the exact opposite. The county was exceeding these levels by 14 percent; that is embarrassing. As mentioned in the article, a huge reason why there is no action is because “there are no teeth in the plans”. What’s the point of having any plans or rules to stop climate change if they aren’t going to be enforced? After reading this article, there is no surprise that Santa Barbara county’s average temperature has warmed by 2.3°C.
         <br><br>

 The article also opened me up to all the natural disasters such as, the Thomas fire and the storm on January 9, 2018, that have occurred due to these drastic increases in the temperature. I'm sure that the people that have been affected by these events have realized how big of an issue climate change is, but the other people must realize this as well. These increases in temperature are affecting the farmers and ranchers as well. Many of them have taken losses in revenue and have had to change their ways of farming due to the climate. If we don’t start putting all our effort into this issue, counties in California will not be the only ones going “beyond the limit”.

Reading this article and realizing how the place I live in is being greatly affected is kinda scary. As when you hear about climate change affecting people you always hear it going on somewhere far  not close to home. California for years now has been said to be in a drought the reasons behind the drought are not discussed. The way climate change is affecting California is not talked about in the news. The rare times it is it is always brief. Which results in many of us not being well informed about what is going on in our state. I for instance had no clue how severely affected farmers are. I knew for obvious reasons that their crops were being affected. However, I did not know that it had resulted in farmers changing from water intensive crops such as avocados to tropical fruits. Water and its accessibility is becoming a bigger problem in California than us californians actually think. We need to do less talking about the environment and start to make more actual changes.

I grew up in Illinois my whole life and experienced a couple of tornado warnings before, but nothing too devastating. The fact that there was a tornado here really shocked me. The amount of massive fires that happened here in a year scared me. Is this supposed to be normal? Whenever I heard about the fires in California on the news, they wouldn't really mention climate change as the root cause of these severe weather events and I never really questioned it until recently. Now that I know these are dangerous effects of climate change happening right here, right now, I feel much more inclined to make some drastic changes in my lifestyle to help somehow mitigate the danger for the future, and I hope others like me feel the same. One thing that I noticed about living in Santa Barbara is that there are actually so many vegan people here compared to anywhere else I've lived before. The culture here is very environmentally progressive, and the initiative to have a meatless diet is a strong sentiment to many people. I feel sort of pressured, not in a bad way, to follow suit and be more environmentally conscious of my diet and my actions. This change in culture really helped push me in the right direction, and I imagine that we will be on the right path to mitigating disastrous events if more and more cities begin to adopt this mindset.

The idea that climate change is some disembodied threat that looms over us from a distance is a widely accepted belief of the majority of Americans, even in primarily progressive places like California. Yet every year is filled with increasingly terrifying and powerful natural disasters. At this point, one can only imagine the threshold needed to be overcome in which climate crisis deniers are forced to face the reality before us. In some places, like Santa Barbara and Ventura County, residents of these areas have already reached this threshold. Farmer's have already begun changing their agricultural focus from plants that require lots of water to those that survive in drier climates, residents have begun investing in private firefighting infrastructure and generators, and thousands have been displaced by natural disasters caused by climate change. Yet none of the aforementioned solutions are proactively fighting climate change, but instead serving as damage control.
         <br><br>

On one hand I can sympathize with those who are hesitant in making drastic lifestyle changes. For instance I still, despite knowing the multiple benefits, have not stopped consuming meat and gone vegetarian. I also love how cheap and readily available parking is in downtown Santa Barbara. So if I, who is actively seeking out information on the climate crisis through classes and articles, can not make the jump, who will? I really liked a quote from "2 degrees Celsius: beyond the limit", it stated: “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.”. It perfectly encompasses the point I want to make: unless someone with authority decides to enact laws and programs that force people to actively think about the consequences of their actions and change them, or invest in geoengineering and other scientific advancements, we are doomed.

2 degrees Beyond the Limit is a startling article and wake up call on the severe climate change and its consequences on the Santa Barbara area. For those living in a beach city, all they think that can happen is the tide rising. However, because of the increased temperature of warming in ventura and santa barbara, the air has lost moisture and gotten more dry, increasing the number and longitunitily of fires occurring. This is startling for always making Santa Barbara sound like the best it can be.

One thing I’ve noticed about the climate crisis conversation is how people tend to place the topic of conversation outside their own neighborhood, moreover they focus on the climate crisis effects on poorer areas. Considering this, this article was intriguing because it gave context into how the rising temperatures will affect our home, and in this sense made the concern surrounding environmental changes that much more serious. It is important to note that Santa Barbara was already an environmentally conscious city resulting from the oil spill that devastated the oceans off the coast and captured the world's attention. With this in mind, why aren’t the residents more concerned for the future of their beloved home. Similar to other political issues (of which I agree with the comment made in lecture that the climate crisis should not be political and instead should spread concern across political lines), concern for the issue at hand usually dies out a few weeks after a major devastation such as the Thomas fire in this case. With the land consistently at high risk of fire, mudslides, erosion, and now susceptible to storms powerful enough to cause tornadoes/ hurricanes, there has to be some sense of urgency surrounding these environmental hazards. Furthermore, the article mentioned the houses of Del Playa, which are getting placed at a high risk of collapsing off the hill and this personally resonated with me as it made the article feel more real by mentioning somewhere I consistently am visiting. I would highly recommend this article to any resident of Santa Barbara/ Ventura County in order to hopefully create a conversation about the future of our home.

I found this article to be quite eye-opening in terms of the consequences of climate change in California. I was not aware that Ventura County is the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states, and thus is impacted by climate change more than other places. Furthermore, a quarter of California’s residents are in high-risk fire zones. These facts are alarming, to say the least, because the impacts of climate change are occurring so close to home, and at such large, significant numbers. It makes me realize just how at risk we are-- because I think of California as a safe region with an ideal climate, like a locus amoenus, the notion that climate change will affect all of humanity, even me, has not registered in my mind completely. Therefore, reading this piece of text has made me realize just how dangerous it is to live anywhere in the world, even in places that seem to be free of extreme natural disasters and weather.
         <br><br>
Also, I was rather disappointed in Santa Barbara County after seeing that the local government, despite taking a positive step forward with its Climate Action Plan, is not enforcing its environmental plans. They put up a pro-environmental front, and yet do not take actions to help mitigate climate change. Rather, they are in support of a fossil fuel driven economy by allowing free public parking and considering oil projects. To me, especially for the latter, this is not much better than the government leaders who deny climate change for economic incentives from the fossil fuel industry. What good is it if all they do is make these empty promises? That does not help the climate crisis either.

The article "2 degrees Celsius: Beyond The Limit" stresses the hypocrisy of people and organizations in the lack of assistance with the problem of the constant rising temperatures. This article was more relevant to students like us who reside in the Santa Barbara and nearby Ventura counties because we know what it is like to live here. I can say that this area is one of the most charming and beautiful cities I have ever seen, so it makes me sad knowing that future generations won't be able to experience it the way I have. It was shocking to learn how Santa Barbara county has had a temperature rise of 2.3 degrees, already above what was seen as the absolute limit. Furthermore, the pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% from the levels of 2007 has been completely dismissed by the current state of an increase in levels by 14%. This supports the fact that Ventura is the faster warming county in the lower 48 states. 
         <br><br>
The effects of this warming has led to catastrophes that many in Santa Barbara are very well aware as such as the wildfires. A quarter of a million of Californian residents now live in high risk fire zones. The notion that this isn't an isolated problem is shown by the disruption of the food chains in the ecosystem. Dead whales in San Francisco Bay were seen to have washed up with empty stomachs, insinuating that their food source, including an array of oysters, crabs, and urchins, is dying out because of the temperature increase. The natural cycles all around us are being put in disarray by one issue, which shows how there is a domino effect and every living being will be affected by this issue.

“2°C: Beyond the limit” reports how global warming influences the life in real. I came to Santa Barbara in 2018, and  I can definitely feel this issue is related to me after reading this article. In California, people relied on nature a lot. This year, thanks to the rainfall, the terrible effects of wildfire, such as dusts and smoke, are minimized. I have a friend who has asthma. She has to stay at the dorm for the whole days because the terrible air quality caused by wildfire. She has to miss the lectures and work harder after thar. Human health is getting threatened by global warming. If people still do not make any changes for this, global warming will affect us in all aspects in life. Even for the healthy adults, the dusty air is hard to stand, not mention the children. Children will suffer from the environmental problems caused by the last generations.

After I read the article “2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT”, I felt shocked because Santa Barbara is in a dry area. Anyone should know that this area is prone to fires (and it actually happened before), but the government has not made many measures to prevent fires. As temperatures continue to rise, the possibility of mountain fires near Santa Barbara is undoubtedly increasing. I don't want to criticize needlessly, but these issues should be taken seriously. People want the government to take some substantial action. Although the government cannot stop the impact of rising temperatures on the economy and agriculture, they can at least prevent fires as much as possible. Some seemingly insignificant measures can also contribute to protecting the environment.

After reading the article I became frustrated at the community of Santa Barbara, which includes myself. I had no idea that our country had agreed to reduce our CO2 emissions by 15%, and that we had horribly failed at keeping this promise. The fact that we are emitting 14% more CO2 than in 2007 shows us that the leaders of our county are not willing to take any sort of financial loss despite the increasing risks of global warming-caused consequences. I was happy to hear that local farmers are looking to grow and invest in vegetation that does not require as much water as for example, the avocado. The small steps taken by individual people will encourage others to make the changes necessary in their lives to limit damaging the environment and the Earth as a whole. As for the people who feel the need to have a large amount of free parking downtown, I think they need to be less selfish and find another means of getting to their destination. I think the county is wealthy enough to build some sort of public transit system that is more environmentally friendly than a car is. This would dramatically reduce the emissions of CO2 in the Santa Barbara area, and hopefully slow the warming down as well. We need to get together as a community and rethink the ways in which we are going about our daily lives. If we all take steps toward being more earth-friendly and vote in favor of things that would essentially reduce the majority of emissions in the area, we will be setting ourselves up for a brighter future. As these fires continue to happen, more and more people are becoming aware that they are in part fueled by anthropogenic global warming. Hopefully, this will serve as a wake up for most, and we can begin to start making changes.

Compromise is the word I subtracted from the article.
         <br><br>

We have compromised our promises we made in the 2015 Paris climate accords, one which was signed by multiple presidents of the world’s most powerful and developed countries—I’m not saying it because of the fact that Mr. Trump promised to quit the course, but because certain places like Ventura County, California had already experienced a rise in temperature of 2.6 degree Celsius.
         <br><br>

We have compromised our most beautiful farms. Farmers are forced to alter their choices of crops and their revenue because of drought caused by the rise in temperatures and to prevent the possible affect certain crops that relies heavily on the consumption of water such as avocado does to trigger drought.
         <br><br>

We have compromised the life of creatures that share our land. The iconic coastal redwood forest was threatened, the bird population had declined at an astonishing speed, the dying of kelp forest caused the whole food chain, from oyster, crabs to whales, to experience famine.
         <br><br>

We have compromised our playground. The once appealing holiday resorts, summer cottages with an ocean view was no longer a place for pleasure. The erosion have consumed the standing space of houses and landslides constantly disturbe the tourists in life-threatening words.
         <br><br>

We have already compromised our bottom line.

As I finished reading the article by Scott Wilson I felt a feeling of distress for the city where I now call home and attend school. Not only did I feel it for Santa barbara but also the whole world in general. As the article addresses, greenhouse gasses have contributed to a raise in temperature throughout the world. This rise in temperature has caused many areas to develop droughts and uncontrollable fires such as the thomas fire which affected the Santa Barbara county. If we don't do anything about climate change then we are going to continue seeing disastrous events accompany the ever rising temperature. In 2017 we saw it with the fire and floods that occured in Santa Barbara, which goes to show you that even places like Santa barbara which pledge to conserve the planet are still in dire need of direction. The fact that Santa Barbara is still growing in emission, is hypocritical to its devotion on change. If change doesn't occur then a repeat of those fires will happen and people will be forced to evacuate their home yet again. However, what I've come to realize is that the it seems almost impossible to reverse climate change because it means changing the way people live. It requires people to live outside of their comfort zone and choose more environment friendly lifestyles. I believe that change will only come when enough people are affected first hand by climate change.

One of the things the article stated that surprised me was that Ventura was the fastest-warming county in the lower 48 states. I had no idea I lived near a county in which was warming pleasantly fast. Reading the article and given actual numbers and statistics was definitely a wake-up call. Before this class, I would often overlook anything I heard about climate change, I still believed in it but did not take it as seriously as the issue that it is.
         <br><br>
It also terrifies me to think that Isla Vista could possibly be underwater if sea levels continue to rise. I myself have been more recently aware of the effects of climate change due to the several fires that I have witnessed and have noticed drier and hotter seasons. I am from the LA county area and when I moved to Santa Barbara I never thought it was affected by climate change as much as the article enforced. I also noticed that a lot of people here are very aware of climate change compared to LA from my experience.

Similar to last weeks article, this one had a lot to take in. It hit very close to home because I have called Santa Barbara home now for nearly 4 years and its enormously frustrating to see everything thats happening right here in our own backyard and then see it widely ignored once the immediate issue is resolved. I recently became a vegetarian because i decided to stop saying "oh i could never do that" and just buckle down and do my part. It's not hard for each of us to do these small things that can have an enormous impact, and obviously a lot more needs to be done than just small things, but something has to come first and it starts with the baby steps. Santa Barbara of all places has to start taking these steps not only because of the recent problems we have faced but also because of the reputation that we have. Hypocrisy doesn't set the best example for the people that need to follow in our footsteps.

I rarely think about the actual effects climate change has on the places i live in. Especially since I grew up in the Bay Area and now I live in Southern California. I think it is astonishing that I was completely unaware of the Thomas Fire or any natural disasters in Santa Barbara. Natural disasters should be more commonly discussed in news outlets and science classes growing up. Especially when Venture, a primarily liberal region is the fastest warming region in California. This is absurd. If it wasn't for this class, I would have never even known about the Thomas Fire. Just before Thanksgiving break we had a fire and I honestly thought it was a norm. Im genuinely disheartened that I thought things were normal. I still want to know how I myself can lessen the contribution to climate change in my home.

When reading the Washington Post article, it talked about a lot of issues and facts pertaining to the area that we currently are living in for our college lives. It was really interesting and eye-opening hearing about the oil spills, Thomas fire, and the mudslides that have occurred all throughout the area. The fact that almost all of those issues have occurred pretty recently is extremely important. It's like a punch to the fact to Santa Barbara that a place where it was supposed to be moving towards a greener and environment-friendly area. It was really interesting to learn too that the Earth Day movement was inspired by the oil spill in the mid-1900s too, also quite alarming to know that a place that I am currently living in is responsible for such a big movement, in a bad way. The cliffs of Del Playa Drive is something that I constantly am aware of and see, and reading about it within the article made it a much bigger deal in my head that I had held it. I received the alert for the tornado too and it was definitely a scary experience, and knowing that these things are going to become much more common and intense within this area is quite terrifying, but realistic and something that we need to prepare for.

“2ºC: Beyond the Limit" surprises me a lot, maybe because it focuses on the place where I’m living right now that brings a stronger resonance. Due to the dry climate in California, drought and wildfire have been the top threats to us, and as the climate becomes even drier nowadays, natural disasters such as mountain fires happens more often, as the article mentioned, two of the three most severe fires have happened in the past two years. The consequences showed in this article is terrible and heart-breaking, and this is also a wake up call to all of us, to worry about the future of our beautiful environment, and put in actions to protect it.

Even though the content of the article may initially seem terrifying, given its proximity to us, if we look back at what has happened in Santa Barbara County in recent years it should not really come as a surprise. Since 2004, there have been 13 major wildfires in the county, totalling over 742,000 acres burned. In comparison, from 1955 to 2004, there were only 7 major wildfires and they burned far fewer acres. Since the turn of the century, both the severity and frequency of fires has spiked in Santa Barbara County, and the fact that the temperature has increased by so much in the region in that same time period establishes a causal relationship with the two figures. That is, the increased temperature has had some impact on the increase in the number and severity of fires.

Just a few short months ago, right before Thanksgiving, the Cave Fire broke out, and from the cliffs on the East side of campus, people could clearly see the orange hue of the flames on the hills. Of the people I saw looking from the cliffside at the fire, more than half of them had no form of terror in their eyes, myself included. Why? Fire has become an accepted part of living in California, and while a natural disaster should scare people, California residents have been desensitized to it, because of how common it is. However it is precisely because it has become common that we should fear now more than ever, as it is nothing but a sign of things to come

It was interesting to read about Santa Barbara and Ventura County in the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit.” It is really eye-opening to hear about the area where I live and attend school being referred to as one of the fastest-warming counties in the lowest 48 states. The Thomas Fire occurred not that long ago in 2017 which burned 281,000 acres and forced many families and students who lived in the area to relocate. As the article stated, we are starting to see the effects of the 2.3ºC increase in Santa Barabara and 2.6ºC in Ventura County. If temperatures continue to rise, the effects can become much more catastrophic. Since Santa Barbara is a place I now consider home, I am starting to see the reality and the danger of the effects of climate change. It is also very frustrating when the current president of our country refuses to listen and see the truth especially since the effects of climate change have become more evident. It also seems hopeless because as the article mentioned, despite Santa Barbara being referred to as the “birthplace of the modern environmental movement,” it has not kept up with its own goals.

As someone who moved to California four years ago, there have been many times where I felt like an outsider looking in. Perhaps an ever more apt analogy would be saying that I often felt like a tourist. California’s culture of activism, openness, and especially the ideal weather are things that I do not take for granted. With that being said, in the past four years, California has become my home. The climate crisis may result in countless disasters so it seems superficial to say the following but realizing that the paradise-like climate and environment that California is treasured for has already started to deteriorate has brought me great distress. More than anything, it definitely proves that climate change is no longer an abstract issue that we can postpone thinking about to a later date. The climate crisis is upon us, it’s affecting my home, our home and it can no longer be ignored. 
         <br><br>


A few years ago I remember hearing on TV that the United States won’t change its fossil fuel economy until climate change started negatively impacted its citizens. Of course, it was implied that once the climate crisis started affecting Americans, then the United States would act swiftly and the rest of the world would follow suit. The USA has long been the leader of the free world, seeking to lead by example as other countries and leaders look to us. And yet, none of this has actually happened. Countless people have lost their homes and livelihoods to devastating forest fires and hurricanes that only seem to be increasing in frequency and ferocity. A large number of authority figures at the helm of this country still insist on portraying climate change as a hoax. The USA as a whole has not mobilized its efforts to address this global problem, and has sought to divert the blame onto other countries like China. In this time of global crisis, the entire world looks to the United States for a model to follow but the leaders of this country have prioritized economic and financial gain while other countries take the lead in trying to steer us towards a better and safer tomorrow. Change only happens when a country’s people start to hold its leaders accountable. Only when the leaders are forced to acknowledge the issue and start implementing real solutions will we be able to truly say that we have done our part. Even then, will it be too little too late? Only time will tell.

In Scott Wilson’s article, “weirdness” is happening everywhere globally. The second largest fire in California and unusually heavy rains happened in Santa Barbara-where we live. Nonetheless, last semester, when I biked to campus in the morning, it was the abnormal heavy fog that often surrounded me. The fog basically just blinded me from seeing anything other than the road under my foot-I literally don’t know where I am going. People after me surpassed me by just heading into the horrible fog. And that was the first time I realized global warming is happening now and it is happening here. In addition, according to the data Wilson provided, the average temperature has risen in Santa Barbara county for over 2.3 celsius degrees, while its neighbor Ventura, where we passed by each time going to LA, has risen over 2.6 degrees. However, according to Wilson, we have to keep temperature rise well below 2 degrees to “avoid potentially catastrophic consequence”.
<br><br>
Now, I believe it is safe to say that the serious effect of global warming is change environment protection into self-protection for human beings and all the livings. What is happening right now in Australia is a horrible example to prove this. The heavy forest fire is spreading along the western coast. At the same time, the heaviest rain in a hundred years is happening in the eastern coast of Australia. In California, effects of global warming threatened redwood forests and bird populations. 23 people and more than $2 billion have lost in the fire. Fire-driven migrations, who we used to think we will not have them here in California, is becoming common in recent years.
<br><br>
Here the question goes: Are we taking actions? Yes, we are. The government of Santa Barbara and California is making regulations to reduce carbon emissions. Well, how is the impact of our self-protection? Wilson answered “ineffective”, as some people believe regulations are nothing more than a paper of word and no one is here to enforce it. The ineffective enforcement sure will leaves us, the new generation, lots to endure. And that is the reason why we need to take the leading role of reducing carbon emission.

Fellow student, <br><br>

I understand your feelings and believe many other students share the same anguish as well. California has always been a paradise in regards to its weather, but that could be the main reason for its demise. People don't feel the need to act and change for the good of the environment unless they feel a sudden threat,  and living in California can affect those odds greater than any other state. Since California seems to always have such great weather, many people don't feel like anything is wrong with the climate, which therefore leads them to not believe in climate change. Unfortunately, that has all changed now, as we have seen an increase of 1.5 degrees celsius around the world and over 2 degrees in the Ventura area here in Santa Barbara county. Now that California has begun to see the dangers of climate change, I hope they begin a shift in their diet and laws to prevent our situation from getting worse.

As an international student, I kind of feel what Beaudin means here, I enjoy and cherish the good weather and atmosphere of California too. My home is a wet, pretty, and urbanized place with good weather but not sunny all the time, so sunshine is actually what make me feel fresh at first when I came to California for university. And so now I’m also one member in the crowd that don’t want the paradise-like place to be destroyed due to human actions. I remember Professor said: 5 largest wild fires in California happened this decade. It is not necessarily caused by what people in California are doing, but through butterfly effect. It is what people around are doing little by little.
<br><br>

No matter, economically, politically, daily living of people didn’t take protecting the environment seriously. People are producing more and more clothing, cosmetics, and such things for getting more money and satisfying people’s mental needing and just taking the environment as the opportunity cost, People are electing for the leading position for “making the human civilization better”, while they are actually saying empty words and making the environment worse.

This article really opened my eyes to the realities of the Santa Barbara area, being from the northern central valley I am very used to high and dry temperatures and wildfires, what surprised me after moving to Santa Barbara is how similar the climate was. I was ready for humid and balmy weather but it was very similar to my hometown, and then my first quarter here there was a wildfire extremely close. It is absurd how much climate change is changing the natural climate of various places and it was extremely eye opening to read the article to see the full extent of it in Santa Barbara as I was not aware of it before. It really makes the effects of climate change seem more real when you see the qualitative evidence of the changes that are happening and it is terrifying.

This article serves as a rude awakening similar to last weeks reading. I found it extremely frightening that even though drastic natural disasters have become so frequent within a short span of time but we still expect something worse every year and try our best to be prepared yet we still are surprised and shocked every year to see it get worse. We always try our best to stay prepared yet we don't actually do enough to prepare ourselves. I found it astonishing that natural disasters could be so dual like how the article described a wild fire  followed by a deadly flood. I also found it important that the article noted how most Americans practically brush off climate change as something important but not “here”. I honestly would have never guessed that Ventura county would have the hottest temperature change in 48 states, I truly had no idea how bad we were affected here in Santa Barbara until i saw the mapped out temperature changes. It's baffling to know that even though we should be the some of the most alarmed here, there is no push or pressure to make environmentally friendly changes. Big businesses know that what they’re doing is killing the earth and in return killing us but they only make rules in response to the damage that we're doing rather than avoiding the damage all together.  This article just goes to show that no amount of preparation will ever be enough for the drastic changes we expect to see in the future unless we actually take solid and enforced action soon.

One part of the article stood our to me from the rest. To quote Edward France, "We're always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that will really change things and that will cost something." I think this is something most of us are guilty of. We are willing to eat less beef so long as there is an alternative product that tastes as good, and so long as we can get it at the same store we usually shop at, and so long as it doesn't cost a penny more. We are willing to switch to electric cars so long as they drive as fast as gas-guzzlers. We seem to have this frame of mind that by making concessions like these we are doing everyone some huge favor, that asking us to make these concessions is asking a lot, perhaps too much, if it means inconveniencing us in any way. We need to start making the connection that our actions have consequences that will ultimately affect us as well as the population at large. For those of us who talk about the dangers of climate change, we must also walk the walk, so to speak. It is our responsibility to set the example for others to follow. If we allow oil drilling in our own backyard, how are we to expect others to take climate change and its dangers seriously?

I was absolutely thrilled last year when I decided to attend a prestigious university in what I thought was the beautiful Santa Barbara bubble with a climate considered perfect and weather that made any student elsewhere jealous. Although I still do enjoy these perks, the bubble is not as safe and comfortable as I expected. Climate change is here, and it threatens even our Santa Barbara sanctuary. It is getting hotter, drier, and windier, which means more intense and regular wildfires, deadly mudslides, and extreme drought. Even something as absurd as a tornado was expected to hit our community so recently. The coastal stretch from here to the Mexican border is warming at double the rate of the continental United States! This means species extinction, warmer oceans and therefore depleted kelp forests resulting in whales washed ashore, year-round fire season, severe losses on ranches due to a lack of water, and so many more devastating facts. I also look forward to hopefully living on the cliffs of Del Playa my junior year, but erosion is the reality. Erosion is expected to claim 78 percent of our city’s beaches by 2060. 
<br><br>

The article laid out what action is being taken in Santa Barbara and what progress has been made, and I was disappointed to hear that neither is significant. It was interesting that Wilson mentioned Santa Barbara being known for its environmental awareness and activism, but then exposed how little is actually being done. The oil industry seems to have control over most aspects of our society, and this is why the fight against climate change has been so difficult. When most of our money is coming from oil companies, or even companies that rely on oil companies, it is difficult to enforce environmental regulation which would reduce their profits. This article was eye-opening because as a student in Santa Barbara, it was laid out for me the reality of my new home.

Santa Barbara, the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, has suffered several severe fire disasters during the past two years as it has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius since 1895. Although I am just a freshman here, I have witnessed a mountain fire last November. The warning alarms of our cellphones rang from time to time made us nervous though we have already got emails from school telling us do not worry about the fire and we were in the safe zone.The article “2°C：Beyond the limit” mentioned words like “no teeth in the plans” and “ environmental poseurs” as typical tags for the Santa Barbara to depict the gap between Santa Barbara’s talk on the environment and its actions. As the cradle and modal of the environmental movement, Santa Barbara always insists that they will try best to control the increase of the temperature within 2°C. But the truth is the increased temperature has surpassed 2°C and even reached to 2.3°C, which brings tremendous impact to the surrounding area. The unwillingness to sacrifice own benefits, or selfish, to reduce the emission of the carbon dioxide is the major to blame for causing this change. For instance, the article mentioned that “parking is the third rail of Santa Barbara politics”, which underlies that people are reluctant to sacrifice a little convenience in exchange for the reduction of CO2 since the proposal about reducing parking lots on downtown put forth by environmentalists are highly opposed by the public. It is true that car is a convenient vehicle, but it is not an essential thing in our lives since we can take public transports as a replacement. 
<br><br>
The consequences brought by the climate change have already shown in Santa Barbara. People who died in fires and people who lost home in fires are the product of climate change. The global weirding, spiked to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, then, nearly as abruptly, cooled down after sunset, caused severe damage like animals died in the heat and avocado harvests fail. Since the drier, warmer climate, farmers switched the plants to more heat-resillient tropical crops, but its commercially viable is uncertain. The electrical power may be cut off from time to time in case of causing fire, which is really inconvenient to people who live around. Climate is no longer something important but remote. It is closely related to our lives. Those consequences should be the motivation for us to take actions immediately!

According to the article and video, it is said that the effects brought by global warming and climate change are already noticed by huge populations. Although people may not be able to physically feel the little differences after the temperature raised by 2~3C, human beings actually are sensitive about the effect of climate change, especially when disasters such as floods, tornados and drought happen. And these always spread fear around people, causing the public to pay more attention to climate change. In such a process, an increasing amount of people are starting to believe in the existence of climate change and address the issue from their daily behaviors.

Touching on the topic of the worry and thought and dangerous fires engulfing Santa Barbara once again, this article dives exactly into the reason why these fires are happening more viciously and often. Hearing all these facts about heat rising especially in Santa Barbara and Ventura county is alarming but good to know because then we understand the rising danger. Being in the area that we are with climates like such changing is almost scary. In 2017 with the Thomas Fire and the mudslides that followed, we see these dangers and worries are very capable of happening in the environment surrounding us. Due to such circumstances I feel all people in areas like such should be aware and ready to take action if a catastrophe were to hit at a random time. When mentioning 40 million people are in high-risk fire zones, that’s a lot of people that need to learn about these dangers and how to prepare for an evacuation in such catastrophes. Not only is the danger of fire risk scary, but other problems such as cliff erosion and other problems are dangers to be worried about as well.

For a long time, I have always thought my small town in the Central Valley was the hottest, the most heavily affected area due to climate change within California. But after read this article, I realize that I am dead wrong and I had never expected places like Santa Barbara and Ventura to be one of the hottest places and the most prone to wildfires in California. I even remember all the people who have said, "Santa Barbara's weather is so perfect! Not too hot, not too cold, just right!" while I respond with, "I don't like the weather, it doesn't feel... normal." Everyone looked at me like I was insane, but after reading this article and seeing the dangers of 'global weirding', fires, and recent storm cells, I can see why I feel like this "paradise" is a false sense of secruity.
<br><br>


I find it more disturbing when I see all the photos and the comments on cliffs chipping away due to the rise of sea level while looking around at the UCSB area. The edges of cliffs disappearing and sea level rise has never been an thing I had to worry about until now, especially when I am currently living in a dorm that is about 6 minutes away from the beach. Seeing the photo of the apartment building having the issue of eroding cliffs just sent chills down my spine and made me feel shocked that this is even real. How can people look at that picture and say "this is not because of global warming"? With the rapid rise of sea-level and the rapid speed of erosion, this will heavily impact all the people who live by the sea, not just those that live in Santa Barbara, but everyone.

The article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" provides a general overview of certain aspects of what climate change has done to the Santa Barbara County and the Ventura region. As someone who has only been living in Santa Barbara for the past year, I can't necessarily fathom or relate when locals say that climate change is happening in own backyards. However, this article provides scientific statistics as well as real people situations that allow me to understand the horrific damages that took place within the past few years. The erosion of cliffs due to rising sea levels on Del Playa was the most alarming to me, because I remember my parents and brother standing on it when they came to drop me off at UCSB my freshman year. The thought that they could've fallen off along with the cliffs terrifies me. Without knowing the facts last year, we were simply overlooking the beautiful sunset on the ocean, but knowing the dangers now, that moment will forever haunt me.

I've lived in Santa Barbara my entire life and it is true that "global weirding" is a thing. I recall in 5th grade there was a very odd incidence of hail, right outside the court house. Then in a span of 10 months, my family and I were evacuated twice due to the Gap and the Tea Fire. Important to note there was still another fire that occurred, the Jesusita fire, but I personally did not evacuate for this fire. I recall crying while packing my things because I couldn't bring all my clothes. I understand that's materialistic of me but remember I was in 5th grade. Clothes and my possessions mattered a lot to me. A few of my friends lost their homes completely from these fires, and thinking back on this it's crazy how I cried over my clothes when they lost everything they owned. Jumping forward, more fires occur. The Whittier fire occurred near in deeper Goleta past Dos Pueblos High School. At the time I was working in a local pet store and people brought in their pet fish for us to look after while they were evacuated. When the Thomas fire hit, crates and kennels for cats and dogs sold out immediately and our store wasn't able to receive more due to road closures. I remember customers who lived in Montecito telling me how they had to just let their horses out and leave them to run for their life. I remember everything just caked in ash. Each fire, everything caked in ash. This is serious. This is dangerous. This is horrifying.

It's very interesting to see how climate and environmental change can impact our local community. For instance, the part where it discusses the eroding cliffsides of Isla Vista is becoming particularly relevant nowadays. Just a few weeks ago, a deck that overhung the cliffs at a house on Del Playa collapsed, falling almost forty feet to the sandy shores below. Thankfully, nobody was hurt, but that just goes to show how building a community on a degrading coastline can have harmful impacts on its residents. Some of the other impacts on Isla Vista/Santa Barbara that arise from climate change include the increasing appearance of wildfires. For example, the Thomas Fire raged through Ventura and Santa Barbara county, destroying thousands of homes and burning over 280,000 acres. Another fire burned a small portion of the Santa Ynez Mountains that is extremely close to campus (about a mile north of El Colegio Rd). 
<br><br>


Seeing these climate-related disasters become increasingly more common in our community is truly heartbreaking, to say the least. As much of a environmentally-conscious community as we are, I'm hopeful that many leaders of our community will stand together in coming up with solutions to protect the area that we call home.

One day before my economics one final exam, a final I had no hope of passing, all classes were canceled and we were asked to leave campus, threatened by the blazing Thomas fire. At that moment I thought the universe was sending relief to a struggling freshman who had never received a grade below a B. Not until I took Introduction to Environmental Science that succeeding quarter did I realize this was no act of the universe but the actions of a dangerously changing earth. In 2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT By Scott Wilson I am furthered enlightened over the origins of these “global weirdings”. Downtown state street looked very different in the months following the wildfires; restaurants, bars, and small businesses offered complementary services to firefighters and displayed signs showing their support for their fight against the fires. Today the threat of these fires is still around yet these signs and promotions have been taken down. This gesture by the Santa Barbara community is a good representation of who Santa Barbaras are in the fight against climate change. In the moment and when facing disaster Santa Barbarans will come together and demand real change. However once the immediate danger has faded, whether this is the extinguishing of the Thomas fire or the completion of the 1969 oil clean-up this movement slowing begins to fade as most return back to their normal way of life inattentive to the still opposing threat. This outlook needs to change if we expect to keep this beautiful chaparral flourishing with life.

The article “2ºC: Beyond the limit” was really impressive and opened my eyes to the details behind the climate crisis. I knew that global warming is affecting everywhere on the earth nowadays, but I have no idea that Santa Barbara is becoming one of the cities being most affected in the United States: its temperature has risen by over 2.3 C. I still remember the wild fire that happened last November before Thanksgiving. It was the first time I felt really close to the consequences of climate change, and I was shocked by the spreading speed of the fire. The article also mentioned the cliff erosion in Isla Vista, and many houses there are already supported by some concrete pillars. I think this is a horrible thing ever happened to this beautiful city, and you will never know when these houses will collapse.

I completely agree with this comment, as I had never really seen the effects of climate change hit so close to home before. The fact that we are able to see the actual effects make it so much scarier and make it seem so much more real than just seeing statistics or numbers online. Also, the thought that most houses on Del Playa Oceanside will have collapsed in twenty years is a horrifying thought and just so utterly heartbreaking. It's nice to see how people care, especially in Santa Barbara but still so sad to see that even though they care nobody is taking real action. In the article" 2 degrees celsius: Beyond the Limit", it says how Santa Barbara has set goals to reduce emissions, yet has completely failed to meet the goal. This just shows how although everyone wants a change, not many are actually willing to take action if it means they have to sacrifice some of their daily enjoyments. This article really opened my eyes on how much this county is being affected by climate change, and how rapidly this amazing place will change.

I also felt very surprised to learn that we live in one of the most affected areas in the US in terms of global warming. When the Thomas Fire happened, it was also my first quite direct experience of climate change and I felt that it would really open everyone's eyes about the problem that we are facing on the planet. Previously, I believed that wildfires were just a natural occurrence and sometimes bad things just happen. Following the experience of the Thomas Fire, my perspective had changed dramatically because it was quite obvious that this wasn't a "natural" event. I thought, oh it's pretty far away so it shouldn't be an issue here. But as it drew closer and closer to Santa Barbara, I among other people here got pretty worried. I thought that if it could go the distance it already has, what's stopping it from reaching our campus? Going forward, being prepared for what natural disasters lie ahead of us includes believing that anything can happen and to prevent it, we need to pressure our city officials to take action to mitigate the growing issue especially since we live in one of the most impacted areas of the US.

This article summarizes the current situation in the Santa Barbara County. As the author points out, “the average temperature in Santa Barbara county has warmed by 2.3 degree Celsius since 1895” . The global warming and rising temperature have been being the main issue in the county. From people’s impression, Santa Barbara is always considered as one of the best holiday resorts in the United States. Currently, however, the circumstance in this county is unexpected during the last ten years. The Thomas Fire in 2017 destroyed nearly 280000 acres of lands in the county. Houses, buildings, and farms were all affected with the fire they must confront with. People were afraid of their apartments being devastated by the massive fire. Before this event, the consequences of rising temperature for a lot of residents is “something important but remote” (par.19. Wilson). I strongly believe that the attitude and mentality of some people are the primary reason that cause them to be in panic. A lot of people do not believe the fire would happen, and they did not prepare for it. In order to solve the problem, I believe that the government might need to increase the government expenditure to control the operation of oil industry and the problem of excessive amount of cars. The leader should set an example on everything such as ride bicycles or take bus to work to reduce the CO2 emissions to the air.

Last quarter, I experienced a wildfire for the first time in my life in Santa Barbara. I thought it was normal in Southern California because  there are many forest and mountain and the weather is dry and hot. However, after reading the article “2°C: Beyond the limit”, I learned that due to climate change, these extreme weather events occur more frequently and intensely. For example, the reading mentions that as temperature rising, Southern California’s mild and predictable weather will become hotter and drier and “in some regions windier, fueling more intense wildfires, deadly mudslides and prolonged extreme drought”. I also noticed that the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has increased by 2.3 degree Celsius, and the temperature in Ventura, the county near Santa Barbara, has increased by 2.6 degree Celsius, which is far beyond the 2 degree Celsius limit set by the Paris Agreement. Paris Agreement is an agreement signed by lots of countries to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C, but the global average temperature has already warmed by more than 1.8 Celsium. What’s worse is President Trump decides to withdraw the United States from the agreement. This article has some unique meaning for us because Santa Barbara is the place we live and study everyday. We enjoy going to the beach, swimming, surfing, and hanging out with our friends. But can you imagine that if the global temperature continues to rise, this place will disappear as a rising ocean slowly erodes them. Besides this, the residents of Santa Barbara also live in high-risk of wildfires. I don’t even realize that we are living in such high risks. Dealing with climate change is not something we do for our next generations, and it is actually for ourselves. If we don’t want to lose our home or forced to leave our home, we have to do something.

To start, while reading the beginning of the passage I was actually quite astonished that they reacted to the fires as it was part of their regular schedule. They even casually said that it has been an annual event since 2016, which should be quite alarming to anyone! I was not aware (according to the 2015 Paris climate accords) that we must keep average warming well below 2 degrees Celsius and it has already reached over 2 degrees celsius in Santa Barbara and Ventura. I was quite alarmed by this and this means we have no choice but to all take action now. It is quite shocking to me that Ventura is to be considered the fastest- warming county in the lower 48 states, this is somewhere very close to us and affects us as well. 
<br><br>
 Moreover, I am glad that Santa Barbara is considered a birthplace in the environmental movement, however it is devastating that it has to be because of all the disastrous fires that people have started to take action. However, it also is disappointing that even though we are taking action in this city it is still indeed a tourist town with interests such as shopping that counteract environmental change. Despite all of Santa Barbara’s efforts, the city has actually been exceeding its levels of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 <br><br>
The most interesting section in my opinion, was the erosion on Del Playa Drive. As someone who lives on Del Playa, I have first hand seen the cliffs beneath the houses fall onto the beaches. It is very scary and so sad that in 20 years these houses may not even be here anymore due to the climate change which we have put upon ourselves. Additionally, the parking situation in Santa Barbara is quite interesting as well since eliminating the amount of free parking should reduce the amount of visitors.

One thing that I found especially interesting about Wilson's article was his explanation of "global weirding" and how it is specifically affecting the Santa Barbara area. I had never heard of this term before but I am so surprised how it is not used more often since I feel that it pretty accurately describes the current situation we are going through in respects to climate change. Climate change is not in full swing yet, but the effects we are experiencing right now are apparent and cause for concern. Seeing how the farmers who grew the same crops for hundreds of years are now having to transition to more drought resistant (nonnative) crops in order to counter the increasing warmer and more bipolar environment is disappointing and unsettling to say the least. Although these farmers are still finding a way to adapt and profit off of agriculture, the wildlife in the region are not as resourceful/adaptive to radical climate change, thus slowly dying off or migrating due to the heat. Moral of the story is that if we continue down this path of emitting greenhouse gases, us humans will most likely be fine, but other living organisms will not. Finally, I feel is important to note that since we are in this strange period of "global weirding", many people (especially climate change deniers) say that this variation in temperatures and weather are just a "coincidence" and shouldn't be any cause for concern. It is this doubt in common trends in scientific data showing a clear trend towards environmental instability that steers us off the path from saving our planet.

I had no idea that Ventura County, our closest neighboring county, was the largest warming county in the lower 48 states. I had no idea that Santa Barbara County was so hypocritical when it comes to real environmental action. I never knew that the oil spill here in Santa Barbara in 1969 is what began Earth Day nationwide. I feel like as Santa Barbara had some of the earliest exposure to the devastating effects of climate change, and they act as if they are so environmentally mindful, that the county has done so little in action to actually fight climate change. 

 <br><br>

I didn't''t find it hard to believe however that the oil lobbyists shut down the real action the county intended to make years ago. Lobbyists will pour whatever amount of money to protect their interests, even if the cost is our planet. It is a sad reality, but the truth is people will continue to do as they always done until they are forced to change by tangible consequences or enough people changing they will too. I would like to believe that we can change overnight but the truth is it is going to be a very long process until we can work against the harm we are doing. Santa Barbara was 14% above a level of emissions from 2007 in 2015 they pledged to reduce by 15%. This course is what enacts real change. Spreading awareness and educating those who do not know the real consequences of climate change is the only hope we have towards creating real change. I am excited to see what we accomplish, but I pray we are not entirely resistant to changing our ways before the climate changes so much there is nothing we can do about it.

After reading the article 2 Degrees Beyond the Limit I was surprised that even though I find California as a whole more environmentally conscious state compared to other states, that many counties in California had already exceeded the 2 degree level found in the Paris Agreement. In addition increased urbanization in Los Angeles and Orange County are found to play a role as to why California is heating up at such a fast rate. According to the article, Ventura county was the fastest warming county in temperature compared to the lower 48 US states. This information was surprising as Ventura is only about an hour away from Santa Barbara.
 <br><br>

In addition, these higher temperatures increase wildfires to places in California where wildfires were uncommon. This also leads me to fear for other places in the world. For instance, Australia had its own season of wildfires; however now most of Australia is in flames. Therefore, the effects of the climate warming have shown that it can easily use these Mediterranean climates and create even better conditions for destructive wildfires that are progressively getting more and more severe.

I'm one of the small percentage out-of-state students that attends UCSB. I had never been to California before I started school here and I remember being terrified at the sight of the fire in the mountains that happened the night before Thanksgiving break started. Standing on the roof of the house, I was assured by my friends that it's just a "normal California thing". They spoke of it very casually. Similar to the people talk about snowfall in the northeast. Regardless, I was on edge.
 <br><br>
Seeing the effects of climate change firsthand is a scary thing. Yet we still refuse to practice what we preach. I've been thinking of this a lot recently so seeing them mention it in the article made me feel less crazy. Most everyone is a hypocrite, including myself. We come to lecture, we learn about the danger, we see the danger, and we claim to support progressive action to fight it. The problem is that as soon as the solutions sound like they'll come at a cost or change our way of life, we are no longer on board. This has to change. I'm not sure how it will/if it will though.

The more I read or learn about climate change, the more I’m left feeling uneasy. The science doesn’t seem to be in our favor. Learning that Santa Barbara county has warmed by 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895,  actually watching the fires in the hills and receiving unexpected tornado warnings have turned the science into our new reality.  Living in the outskirts of of Angeles my whole life, I never really saw the effects of climate change back home. I never had to worry about my home catching on fire because of a wildfire or any extreme weather events. Now that I’m here at UCSB, I’ve learned so much about climate change that I’ve been moved to change my diet and lifestyle and do my part as an individual. After all this, I’m left feeling like I have to do more, yet I don’t know what exactly to do. This article only highlighted everything else going on because of climate change from warming oceans to wildfires right in Santa Barbara county. Many people have had to change their livelihood and have invested a lot of money to protect themselves from the consequences of climate change. On the other hand, as the article acknowledges, we have also seen a lack of preparedness. Not only in the people, but also in huge corporations and governments. Corporations like PG&E have not been able to adapt to these new norms. Local governments seem to be making somewhat empty promises towards goals of becoming climate friendly. The federal government doesn’t even acknowledge climate change. I don’t understand how much loss and damage has to be made before we actually start to take this issue seriously.

“2ºC: Beyond the Limit" hit home for all of us. I think it is really important to understand that climate change is happening everywhere, even here where it’s supposed to be “perfect.” I took an Oceanography class last school year and I was really intrigued to learn about erosion. It’s actually crazy to think that Isla Vista won’t be the same as it is now. When I come to visit as an alumni I can only imagine what Del Playa will look like. I think the fires that are really close are terrifying. I know the year before I came to Santa Barbara exams had to be canceled so that students could leave. This year, when I went home for Thanksgiving break I remembered the fire lining the hills, so close that you could see them from Isla Vista. I was really surprised to see that Ventura is the fastest-warming county in all of California.  I like how the article mentioned that climate change had been something people were aware of but never really cared about because they couldn’t see its effects. Unfountely, the effects are clear and evident and there is still not enough action being done on our part. Another thing I found really interesting in the article was that farmers are having to grow different things because the climate is changing so much. Like mentioned in the video, California is responsible for producing almost half of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables grown in the United States. With that being said, it is kind of scary knowing that we might not be able to produce these things anymore, or at least not enough of these things.

I spent my first quarter finals week at UC Santa Barbara running from a fire. The Thomas Fire swept into the county, terrifying my parents and forcing me and my classmates into a horrifically poisoned air. Looking back at it, I remember huddling under Storke Tower with my friends, looking out the window and being absolutely shocked at the terror that had flooded our campus. The UCSB campus was not physically affected by the fires, but I remember all of it – I remember watching as UCSB took in evacuees, as Isla Vista residents set fire to couches, as Student Health ran out of N-95 masks and as the country panicked. (I also remember the many, many memes.) Two years later, only a few months ago, another fire came even closer to campus – but we were lucky, and our campus wasn’t harmed, but I watched weeks later as my family’s community was destroyed by mudslides. The Washington Post article shows in great detail how this is our new normal, and how Santa Barbara has been uniquely affected by climate change. It’s an interesting angle looking at this from an outside perspective – knowing that I lived through this, only two years ago. Every brushfire alert I receive means realizing that I will inevitably have to flee more fires.

Reading over this article really had me thinking that I may have picked one of the worst places to live at this time. I picked this school without doing any background on it since I heard it was a beautiful school and I thought I’d happily be able to live here. When I first visited this school I was amazed by the view of both the mountains and the beach. Seeing houses looking over the water on those cliffs made me want to live there. However, now that I read this, it seems like it would be more of a nightmare to live there. You would be constantly scared and unaware of when it would just give away. Also, all I see when I look at the surrounding, once beautiful mountains, is the consequences of the fire. This once beautiful school is now like a ticking time bomb. You never know when some tragic incident is about to occur. This is my first year going to this school and already so much has happened. I remember I was so excited to live by the beach and went out with my friends to go into the water, but was surprised to see this black stuff, I didn’t know was tar at the time, all over my feet. It honestly just turned into a hassle going to the beach, because it was so hard to take off every time, that eventually I just stopped going as often. I had no idea what the stuff was or why it was there and I asked so many of my friends and family members and some had no clue, some had ideas, but none were correct. That just shows how unaware of these issues people are and this all started so many years ago and people are still yet to find out. It’s sad to see that these beautiful sceneries are turning into places people do not even want to visit anymore.

After reading the 2°C: Beyond the limit, I see a totally different side of Santa Barbara. As a foreigner, I heard that Santa Barbara is described as a perfect place to spend vocation and a paradise from all the disaster. It seems to be true based on what I have seen. As an environmental study majored student, I learned that here is the birthplace of modern environmentalism, and its notorious oil spill. However, this article makes me shamed since I haven’t realized how situation are getting worse and worse here while I’m looking for evidence in other places. In where I come from, the effect of air pollution attracts more attention than climate change due to its profound effect, but in Santa Barbara, the threat of climate change is right in our face. The more and more frequent mountain fire has devastated millions of dollars of properties, whereas the government or some corporations reject to change due to the profit cut. It is so ironic that people only care about their own business when they know that the crisis will eventually fall on everyone, and the birthplace of modern environmentalism has an increasing rate of greenhouse emission. I can’t help myself to recall the conversation from the Indian lady (sry for cannot remember her name.) that if US, who has most abundant resource and advanced technology, are unwilling to shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy, why would the countries from the third world, which even cannot afford a basic life, should achieve goal?

Before reading this article, I believed we were living in an environmentally conscious area. I saw Santa Barbara and UCSB as great role models for other cities. I remember hearing statistics about UCSB and the County as places where we were ranked as green, and renewable energy, etc. After reading this article and seeing what is happening around us, I felt like our city and county were hypocrites. Santa Barbara and Ventura County are heating up quickly and are not doing enough about carbon emissions. This only makes me think, we as students who are taking this class, now have the knowledge about the statistics about where we are, and can do something about it. It is important to make a change in our city before we see more cliffs disappearing on DP, and before the gas emissions continue to increase as well. When the article said “we are not nearly as progressive as we think…”, I felt somewhat betrayed because I thought we as a city and as a school were being role models for other schools. I thought since the 1969 oil spill, Santa Barbara became more conscious about what they were doing. Sadly we are not doing enough, and we have not learned our lesson. Lastly, using the aspect on the article where you could type in your county and see the temperature rise, it was sad to see my home county have a temperature rise of 1.9 degrees Celsius.

I’m from a city here in Southern California called Camarillo. It’s a very ordinary city, our two only attractions being an outlet mall and a totally haunted University, Cal State Channel Islands. The whole city closes by nine and nothing exciting happens for the most part. The days are primarily sunny with a cool breeze and overall, everything seems extremely moderate. This is the city I know, but Camarillo is in Ventura County which is stated in the article to be the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states. 
 <br><br>


The concept that global climate change is here and happening is generally known, but often it’s too hard to realize the effects of it until it is too late to do anything about it. The first time I was able to really grasp the concept that climate change is here and going to affect us all was when the Thomas Fire hit a few years ago. Over winter break of my junior year in high school I remember sitting with my friends trying to keep up with the news of the growing damage that the fires had caused and checking to see if we had to evacuate. I saw my community as well as other neighboring communities affected. 
 <br><br>


The next year, the same thing happened with the Woolsey fires and the Hill fires which threatened my city and a large number of my friend’s and family’s homes. School was once again cancelled for weeks, the city’s air quality terrible and the moral of its residents even worse. After this, seeing fires burning all around, it occurred to me that this was the new normal. School’s would have to start factoring in fire days to stay on schedule. 

 <br><br>

I think that a reason why it is so hard for people to take climate change seriously is because they aren't able to see it’s drastic effects until it is too late. Camarillo to me has always been categorized by boring nights and cool breezes, but for the past two years, fires have burned all around the city and anxiety because of this is inevitable. The reality is no one is safe from climate change; if it is not taken seriously, the damage and destruction it causes will be even worse.

The article “2 Degree Celsius: Beyond The Limit” by Scott Wilson really refreshed my mind. Before reading this article, I have never realized global warming is so close and getting even more serious. It is now impacting every one of us on this planet. Everyone’s action is now affecting our planet. As a result of that,  Everyone’s life will be affected by climate change.
 <br><br>
According to this article,  the temperature in southern California  has increased 2ºC on average. When I first came to Santa Barbara, I was really astonished by the beautiful scene. I have never thought climate change and potential catastrophes have actually come to such beautiful places. The cave fire,  hurricanes  and so on are also the result of the climate. Everything that we do now matters. We have to take action right before the potential catastrophes actually come.

As it was last weeks reading, "2 degrees celsius: Beyond the limit" was another wake up call for me as we are experiencing the severe effects of climate crisis here in this beautiful county we live in. Life is being transformed in Southern California as we know it. As mentioned in the article, the weather used to be predictable here in SB county and now it is really hard to tell. For example, last week there was a day of hard rain while the following day after there was a lot of sun and seemed just like the usual summer day in IV. As said in the article, since 1985, temp in SB county has risen 2.3 degrees celsius. This is a huge amount compared to my county, San Joaqin, which only showed a 1 degrees celsius change. This is astonishing as it explains the previous fires that have threatened many areas in SB county and the neighboring counties. Before climate crisis was important to people here in these counties, but very distant and remote. Now, we face this severity of a problem as civilians worry it can continue to cause more fires and bring more threats.

Like last week's article, this week's Washington Post article was quite jarring. I find it a little discouraging that the county of Santa Barbara, which is seen as one of the more liberal and active areas regarding climate change recognition and prevention, has in reality done very little in efforts to slow the crisis. It seems like they make goals and promises regarding the change in climate, but take no action towards these goals and promises. Situations like these make it seem like even the most liberal of areas still make its decisions based on money in the end. Unfortunately, what we see from government officials is a reflection of the values of society. Politicians typically base their decisions off of what will be received well by the public in an attempt to stay in office. While it would be nice to have officials that put the good of the public ahead of their own desire for control, I believe it is unfair to put the blame on them. Part of their job is, in fact, to represent the values of the citizens they represent. The truth is that people care much more about short term concerns and consequences, like those involving money, over what will happen in the long term, like climate change. This in turn causes the people that govern these citizens to hold the same values. I do, however, believe that with time people will come to see that climate change is much more of a short term crisis than they had initially thought as more and more natural disasters and other problems associated with climate change that were talked about in the article come up. Hopefully it doesn't take many more disasters to open the eyes of the public, but it does not seem likely.

Being born and raised in Southern California, I have definitely witnessed changes in the weather in the 19 years I’ve lived here. Our summers are definitely getting hotter, there’s no doubt about it. Temperatures can reach up to 110 degrees where I live, and that is insane. I don’t even want to think about how hot our summers will be in another decade. It’s disheartening to see our state’s forest die due to droughts and fires. If we do not take action now, we may no longer have any forests left. 
 <br><br>

This is my first year at UCSB and the week of thanksgiving break, Santa Barbara was met with a wildfire. It was completely shocking, I could literally see the fire happening from my dorm. What Leah Stokes said is true, we are not nearly as progressiveas we think. The fact that erosion could claim up to 78 percent of Santa Barbara’s bluffside beaches by 2060 makes me appreciate that I was born when I was born. We are currently living in a time of climate change, but I could not imagine how much worse it will be in three to four decades. It’s discouraging knowing that our beautiful campus might not be so beautiful in the future.
 <br><br>

I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole state of California ended with a wildfire. California might not even be habitable considering how our temperatures stay rising. If our farm animals and crops are dying, then we’re next.

I'm also from Southern California and I can agree that the weather these past few years have been “off". I remember on the day Ken read the syllabus he included an image that read along the lines of "stop saying these have been the hottest temperatures and start realizing that these will be the coolest temperatures!" The significant increase in temperatures all year round isn't something normal, it's an effect of climate change. Where I live, there isn't really a forest nearby so seeing a fire isn't that common to me but ever since I moved to Santa Barbara, I can say I've been close to a wild fire before. Committing to a UC, I assumed a very healthy and pro environmental lifestyle ahead of me. Although it is an improvement to my hometown, I expected more. UCSB sits right along the beach, I assumed a tree lover atmosphere. As a first year, I haven't been here that long but I've heard about Santa Barbara's history. It's crazy how many people tweeted about finals being canceled instead of the dangers of the most recent fires. I'm not sure how it is in other areas, but I hope SB becomes more cautious about the prevention in wildfires and droughts.

After reading "2C Beyond the Limit," one thing that really stood out to me was the way many people dealt with the crisis. The article mentions how people are trying to adapt to the climate and looking for ways to still make money while not having water to grow crops or food supply. Although its  great to adapt to new environments, I believe that these people have just come to the conclusion that there is nothing we can do about the climate crisis and should just "deal" with it. As a community we need to not accept defeat and look for solutions. I would also like to address the temperature rise that we are experiencing here in the surrounding Santa Barbara county. As a student here at UCSB, I never knew about this situation before taking this course. I believe that we as a Camus are doing a great job of putting our part but we need to also communicate the issue more around campus and the surrounding area. We can't do this alone, everyone must contribute.

In reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit,” I learned about the horrific extent to which the climate crisis has been affecting California, and more particular Santa Barbara for the past years. From this article and this clip, I found it important how the article emphasizes the fact that the climate crisis not only affects distant countries, but our own home. This made me think of people in America who still think that the climate crisis is distant from us. This clip highlights that some Americans think that this is an issue of global warming, that has only led to the melting of glaciers and rising sea levels. However, many who acknowledge the changes in the climate, do not see it as a problem at all, but rather as a natural environmental cycle and adaptation. It is sad to personally know many people who are apathetic toward the crisis and still think that it is a problem that should not be dealt with. Many don’t know how disastrous these wildfires have been to us as inhabitants of California and only see the rising temperatures as “normal hot days,” or “California weather.” 
 <br><br>

I have learned so far, that the climate is changing here as it is everywhere.Who knows what other things will occur and how severe the future consequences will be. As a student, I am determined to change the misconceptions some people have about the changing climate by taking what I learn in this course and sharing it with others. As a family member, I am also planning ways to reach out to my family, and let them know that the crisis is not only affecting countries from afar, but the country we live in.

Reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" was definitely opening and a bit scare because it discussed Santa Barbara which is a place many students including myself now call our second home.The fact that Santa Barbara and Ventura both exceeded 2ºC which was the threshold of the Paris Agreement is astonishing. Cliff erosion, crop droughts , and fires are all consequences of climate crisis and they are being to appear all over the world a lot more than expected. Many of us are lucky enough to not have these disasters affect us first hand; however, there are people out there who suffer from these consequences and we need to realize that can be any of us one day. Farmers struggling to grow their crops and animals losing their home due to our  choices is absolutely saddening. 
 <br><br>

It is very easy for most of us to feel bad for the damage being done due to climate change and want to make a change, but when it comes down to actually committing to it most of us fail. This is because we have been lucky enough to enjoy the life we have while creating climate crisis without directly being affected by the consequences but that is starting to catch up to us. Right now it might just be fires and crop droughts every now and then but eventually these events can become consistent and become dangers to all of us. This is a scare thought but one that has to be processed by all of us in order to make a change .

As a student of University of California, Santa Barbara, I am very interested in the surrounding environment. Standing on my balcony and looking at the ocean and mountain is enjoyable. However, at the end of 2019, when I saw the fire spreaded out quickly on the mountain, I started to panic and question the climate issues. Last Santa Barbara fire was so close to us, and I was almost evacuated. According to the article, "since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius". If the trend of continuous heating is not stopped, the consequences could be even more terrible. Human activities have impacted not only humans, but also other creatures, such as whales. Thirteen whales were dead this year in the San Francisco Bay area.
 <br><br>

It is crucial for everyone in the county to respond to the rising temperature. The zero emission is far but reachable. It will be a revolutionary moment for all citizens of earth. I can see that UCSB is already working ahead to reach such a goal. However, this revolution will be a huge and dramatic challenge to the fossil fuel industry. Many actions and regulations must be signed and acted.

Learning that the climate crisis has had such a profound effect even in places such as Santa Barbara, widely touted by many to have one of the best climates in the US, is incredible. The first thing I picture when I hear "tornado" is The Wizard of Oz. Tornadoes are nowhere near a reality for me. In Santa Barbara we're only accustomed to dealing with earthquakes and erosion. We have no infrastructure and no preparation for tornadoes. As Ken mentioned in the video, his house was built in the 20s, which is pretty common here. Something else that amazed me is that while climate change is starting to affect rich areas and not just poor ones across the globe, we are still not doing about it. Because of this, I think it is very likely that some powerful forces like the fossil fuel industry have a lot to gain from ignoring it.

It’s mind boggling how much the temperature has seemed to increase within such a short amount of time. Like the article “2°C: Beyond The  Limit” mentioned Santa Barbara and Ventura have increased by more than two degrees Celsius. As a student at a university here, it makes me sad that this will only get worse before it gets better and that not all the things I’ve enjoyed here might not exist in the future. But this article has illustrated that this crisis is already affecting us. It is just the beginning, yet the effects are already so costly or devastating. The article also showed me a lot of these issues created can cause more destruction as they often come hand in hand. For example, one of the people talked about in the article planned in case something happened but at the same time different erratic weather caused the electricity to be out and the plans turned out to be useless. I especially liked this article because it was relevant to me and the place I live.

After reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit", I feel like the only way people are going to realize that climate change exists is when it is already too late. Temperature is already reaching 110+ degrees fahrenheit in places where the temperature is supposed to be welcoming. I come from a small town called Calexico in the Imperial Valley where temperature are usually  110+ degrees fahrenheit, I understand this because it is a desert. So coming here to Santa Barbara was really nice. The weather was beautiful, still is, but knowing that it can potentially be 110+ degrees fahrenheit is frustrating. That type of temperature is not fun, you can not hang out with your friends outdoors, you can not go to the park to walk your dogs, you are just stuck indoors until sunset when the temperature is cooling but by then it is already dark. The climate here in the Santa Barbara is beautiful and we are taking it for granted. 
 <br><br>

We need to realize this not just for us but also for the crops. I did not know that 50% of nuts, etc are grown in California. When the temperature rises it destroys the crops and even kills livestock. I can live with 110+ degrees fahrenheit, I did it for 7 years but I and everyone else can not live without food.

The main thing that I drew from this article was that without a radical shift in the mindsets of our politicians as well as the voters themselves, we will always be in this never ending cycle of scientifically predicting the gloom future without any action until it is staring us in the face at our doorstep. The problem is, that the mass public is never even hearing about the major risks and changes to our climate that are barreling at us like a locomotive, and when it is reported, an equally strong force of big business paid media outlets are ready to shoot down the facts. I live in Northern California about 90 minutes from Paradise, the way the valley works and the wind currents carried the smoke, it ended up in my hometown. You couldn't even see 20 feet in front of yourself. I did some research at the time and found out that where I lived had the second worst air quality in the entire state, only second to Chico. I bring this up because on the day that the smoke was un bearable, I worked at my local golf course and we refused to shut down, ignoring the potentially harmful fumes just to make some money. Businesses are never going to stop what they are doing until continuing to operate with the forms of fuel they lose hurts their profits. I believe that education as I said in my comments last week, is something that needs to be done on this topic, whether people like it or not because the world is dying at our grasps and we are the only ones that can prevent that.

2C gives us an amazing insight into the reality of climate change. It tells us that the IPCC was wrong and why we have failed to act

The article “2°C: Beyond the limit” was a very engaging read for me because it felt personal. The article mentioned the disastrous fires that have affected regions between Santa Barbara and San Diego - both of the places I call home. Though Santa Barbara upholds itself for kickstarting the “modern environmental movement,” it is undeserving of the fame surrounding the title until we see changes actually starting to happen. To know that parts of the neighborhood here in IV are practically falling apart around us and will not even exist in a few decades - I feel like that deserves more than a simple warning sign getting hung on the fences around the cliffs. It deserves action and cooperation. Santa Barbara has a certain beauty and charm to it, being a beach town that seems to promote preservation and awareness to the environmental movement. If we do not change, and if we don’t set a good example for the other regions that have followed in our lead for this movement, then what can get done?

Living in an area that is increasing in temperature faster than any other area forces me to open my eyes to this issue. In my next two and a half years at UCSB, I should be able to fully witness the effects of our fossil fuel dependency. Will we rapidly experience more powerful storms and wilder fires? Or have we just seen the end of a natural cycle making the upcoming years safer in terms of the number of wildfires?

Although the number of Tesla's I see on the road are increasing; this area is plagued with traffic. The US-101 highway that connects the central coast to LA never seems to be empty which continues to pump CO2 into this area. With 92,000 residents, Santa Barbara is no small town and with the average residential property costing 1,000,000 dollars, it has no shortage of wealth. I believe that Santa Barbara should be far ahead of the eco-friendly movement but the state of the climate here says otherwise. As 2050 approaches will the people of Santa Barbara find a way to fight the rising temperature or will it only get worse.

I personally found this article to be very interesting and at many parts quite surprising. The part of the article that stood out to me the most was when the author describes the differences between how Santa Barbara is perceived versus what Santa Barbara is actually doing. I found this part very surprising because I consider Santa Barbara to be very environmentally conscious. Learning that this is not actually true when it comes down to the legitimate policies and regulations of Santa Barbara County was very disappointing and saddening. It is very interesting to see all of these governments who are clearly very aware of the climate crisis choose to ignore it, instead of trying to help. I feel like a lot of us can relate to this, at least slightly, when we think about how long we have been aware of the crisis compared to how long it has taken for us to make any type of significant changes to our lifestyles (if we have at all). It is extremely sad that we continuously choose to be lazy instead of actively fighting climate change, because if we were all to stop making the more convenient/easier decisions then we would be able to make a much bigger impact. This article really made me think about how lucky I am to be attending school in such a beautiful place, and how I don't want to take it for granted.

After reading the article “2 Degrees Celsius: Beyond The Limit”, I was surprised to see how hypocritical Santa Barbara is. I always thought that we were a very conscious people who understood the need to move to renewable resources and cut back on our CO2 emissions. This article made me realize that it doesn't matter how much we talk about an issue and try to get people to understand it, if we don't ourselves take initiative and stay true to our words, how can we expect anybody else to do the same.  I'm glad that as a school UCSB has made massive movements towards a more sustainable way of being like switching to two-way flush toilets, putting up signs about water and toilet paper usage, and also the amount of student led organizations that push for environmental causes. I pray that we (Santa Barbarans) can make a difference by practicing what we preach and actually taking action to save our environment from extinction.

As many of my peers have mentioned, I found it very surprising that in attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, Santa Barbara has been exceeding its 2007 levels by 14%, a change in the complete opposite direction! It's a little disheartening, as so many looked to Santa Barbara as a place of hope and change, but results don't reflect that perception. I also found in interesting when the Santa Barbara County Supervisor Dan William said, "Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world - something important but remote." I never really considered that this is how people view the problem of climate change, but the more I think about it, the more I realise that this is many people perceptions, and that it is so so dangerous. Its just very surprising considering the consequences are being felt at this very moment. I think this article is an important wake up call in showing that you can't believe that everything is okay just because of the way it is perceived. So many, including myself, believed Santa Barbara to be more a part of the solution than the problem, which makes many think that they don't have to do much more to help. But this isn't the case at all. We cannot just sit here and do nothing because we think we are already doing something. Thinking we're being progressive and not doing anything can be just as dangerous as not being progressive and adding to the problem.

This article really made me think back to last quarter when I saw a fire lit up nearby UCSB in the mountains versus just hearing about the Thomas Fires during my freshmen year. In my opinion, people today tend to not realize how harsh a natural catastrophe is until it directly impacts them, and this might be based on people already being very busy with their own lives in terms of trying to accomplish things on both a materialistic and status level. Das Williams, the SB County Supervisor, says that these fires were “Something important but remote…Now, I’m confronted” and I assume this is the reaction of many people as disasters threaten to take away the things you love the most. Scott Wilson emphasizes the importance of climate change topics such as temperature increase and other pressing issues such as flooding throughout the article. Wilson later changes the topic to the impact of environmental problems with society by discussing farmers and small businesses. The rising temperature in the environment is an important topic to focus on as it becomes an inhabitable place like we learned last week. This week this article shows us all the different ways that places are becoming inhabitable for many people and animals directly through causes like forest fires. It concerned me to imagine the rise in temperature both on a local and worldwide scale as it can take away water sources and burn life. For instance, the 2015 Paris Climate accord exceeded temperature by 3 degrees higher which essentially means the environment has gotten a whole lot hotter than it used to be which connects to the idea of a 2.3 degree Celsius rise in Santa Barbara as well and the frequent fires we hear about in the news as Australia presently suffers through the consequences of natural disaster. The only thing we can be is to hope for a change and to try to act now despite all the pessimistic events that are currently happening in the world.

I was very surprised to learn of the rage directed towards the city of Santa Barbara and its hypocrisy. Learning that the temperature has risen by 2.3 degrees celsius here and 2.6 in Ventura (making it the fastest warming county), it is mind blowing that more attention hasn't been drawn to this evidence. Additionally, according to the agreement maintained by the Trump administration, it is unbelievable that dramatic changes haven't been put in place to help aid these counties in their changes. There is hard evidence showing how these extraordinary temperature increases have consequences like crazy fires, yet nothing seems to be done. Yeah Santa Barbara has paper straws, but it needs a climate plan to combat this crisis and stop contributing to it.

"2ºC: Beyond the limit" <br><br>

Before I start my comment, I would like to take the time to recognize and acknowledge the Chumash people who were the first to occupy the land that we call UCSB, Isla Vista, and Santa Barabara.  
 <br><br>

I assumed I was safe at UCSB. Safe from atrocities of the “real world,” but the Thomas Fire proved me wrong. It was my first year, first quarter at UCSB when the Thomas Fire hit Santa Barbara. Prior to this wildfire, I had no experience with a wildfire before since I lived in the lower end of Los Angeles. After a week of poor communication from UCSB, classes were finally cancelled and we were finally asked to leave the campus. As I drove along the 101 South to get back home, the entire highway glowed from the fires in the mountains. This terrifying image is all I could think about while reading the beginning of "2ºC: Beyond the limit.” 
 <br><br>

I was confused about how there could be a massive wildfire near the beach during the Winter. After reading "2ºC: Beyond the limit,” it makes much more sense how this was and still is possible. As the article Santa Barbara County Supervisor stated in the article, I also saw wildfires as “something important but remote.” However, after living in Isla Vista for the past 3 years, I have become more aware at how climate change is affecting us constantly. Ever since the Thomas Fire in 2017, there has been a common joke amongst UCSB students: what natural disaster will it be this quarter? This dark, yet revealing joke points at the fact that we have become accustomed to the reality of our dying earth, just as Bowman.



</p><hr>


<p>
According to Scott Wilson’s article, 2C Beyond The Limit, climate change for Americans is an important problem but it is remote. Many people in Santa Barbrara, though green conscious, held these same beliefs. That is until the rise in wildfires since the 2010s. One such devestating fire was the Thomas Fire in 2017. It has been proven time and time again that the coastal curve that bends south from Santa Barbara through Los Angeles and along the Mexican border is warming at double the rate of the continental United States. In the past century, Santa Barbara county has warmed by 2.3 degrees celsius. This rise in temperature threatens the life of flora (redwoods and Joshua trees) and fauna (whales and woodland creatures). With the deadly combination of scorched earth from the fire and storms, a massive landslide occured in Montecito, killing 23 people. Still local gorvernment in this area largely chooses to invest in the oil industry and continues to increase its greenhouse gas emissions by 14% when they promise to cut back by 15%. Santa Barbara’s coastline is doomed to disappear by 2060 and take with it much of Santa Barbara and Isla Vista infrastructure down with it. The rise in temperature decreases coastal moisture which erodes coastlines and increases the risk of fires like the Thomas Fire. Farmers and vineyard owners have begun replacing grapes and avocados as their main crop with exotic fruits and plants such as dragonfruit, coffee beans and agave. Tequila which is native from Mexican and Southwest American deserts is now being cultivated in Central California. A large oilspill occured in the Santa Barbara coast in 1969 and was so massive that the afteraffects are still felt today. This oilspill inspired the creation of Earth Day and labeled Santa Barbara as a green county, however these are just words on paper because local government still largely supports business over the environment. This, obviously needs to change.

The article 2°C Beyond the Limit grasped my attention in a way that most other articles about climate change couldn’t. While most information regarding the climate crisis talks about national or global consequences, Wilson addresses the implications in southern California specifically - where the effects hit close to home. I was stunned when I heard that Ventura and Santa Barbara counties had the highest temperature increase in the U.S.; I would have never imagined that to be true judging by the temperate climates and eco-friendly disposition. This leads me to my next point: I also appreciated the fact that Scott Wilson was willing to call out people living in cities such as Santa Barbara for being somewhat hypocritical - we say we want to help stop climate change, yet we don’t necessarily practice what we preach. Wilson’s point about how the availability of free parking affects how many people on the read was extremely interesting to me. If we can reduce the number of cars on the road we can easily reduce emissions, and we can easily reduce the number of cars on the road by getting rid of free parking. However, most Santa Barbara citizens would not want to sacrifice free parking for what seems to be a slight solution to the climate change problem. Neither is everyone willing to give up beef even knowing how harmful it is for the planet. I completely understand why it is difficult to make these sacrifices, especially because we may not truly see the positive impact of them, but I do believe that is important that we recognize our hypocrisy in order to start to make small changes in our lives that benefit the planet.

<p>
As I read the article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" one thing that had me annoyed was the fact that Santa Barbara is actually failing to stick to their anti pollution laws. When I arrived in Santa Barbara last fall I was excited to not only be attending a school that cared about our environment, but living in a city that took steps to correct the climate. However, it was quite discouraging to see that Santa Barbara is not only developing and investing more in its personal interests, an issue that has become detrimental to the climate crisis, but also raising its carbon emissions. It's one thing to see other areas of the world being affected by the climate change but to hear that a city so close to the beach is failing to adhere to laws set to protect our environment is truly saddening. It's even worse to see that we are seeing first hand what the change in climate is doing to our environment, as just last quarter we were losing balconies due to cliffs eroding. As I was reading, it was also concerning to see that Santa Barbara's temperature has risen 2.3ºC. If the people living in Santa Barbara are seeing the results of our changing climate and still failing to really do something about it, then I don't know that I have hope for other cities.

<p>
This article is crazy. It really opened my eyes, and it scares me just how much Ventura has heated up. Scientists have told us that we need to keep global warming below 2 degrees C, but I'm not confident that we will be able to do that. Global temperatures are rising, and people are still in denial. It baffles me how people still don't understand that climate and weather are not the same. Weather is short-term, while climate refers to long-term conditions in the atmosphere. Just because parts of the world are experiencing extremely cold winters does not mean that global temperatures aren't changing. I appreciate Rskey and Hvolboll. They're a great example for older generations. This is the type of motivation we need in the United States. My generation and younger generations are dealing with the effects of climate change, but that doesn't mean that boomers and Gen X people shouldn't care about the planet.
 <br><br>


Santa Barbara has huge room for improvement. I had no idea that the city was all talk and no walk. There is no legislation that will help slow down climate change, and there is an obvious lack of control on oil drilling and fracking, two major problems we face. Santa Barbara is supposed to not only set an example, but also follow it. If not, who will? I want to inspire others to change. There's a difference between wanting to do better and actually doing it.

The article "“2°C: Beyond the limit” revives an etched memory that I have of the Thomas wildfires that destructed a huge portion of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. My father works for various government police authorities and the military. With years of military experience, he underwent various rescue training. He got certified in water rescue, fire protection as well as driving firetrucks. 

 <br><br>

During the Thomas Fires, he got assigned by his agency to drive firetrucks and help stop California's eighth-most destructive wildfire. My father was gone for almost a month fighting the fires. The Thomas Fire saw over 8,500 firefighters from different counties, gathered to fight the fire. This was the largest mobilization of firefighters for combating any wildfire in California recorded in history.
  <br><br>

I live in LA and although there are not that many huge fires there, the heat during the summer has escalated due to the climate crisis. The article gives Santa Barbara the title “the birthplace of the modern environmental movement”. Despite Santa Barbara's efforts to reduce its part in greenhouse gas emissions, the people in the county is never safe from the effects of the climate crisis that doesn't give mercy on anyplace, and anyone.


</p><hr>


<p>
This article shares real life events that are occuring close to home due to climate change. I knew some of the details that were in the article, but I never really understood the magnitude of these events. For example, I was aware of the erosion in Isla Vista, but I was not aware that some buildings were already on the edge of the cliff and being reinforced with netting and concrete columns. I was a little more familiar with the fires and its consequences considering there was a fire at the end of last year. I learned that this affects much of the farmland, and is also very difficult to defend against. Larry Saarloos invested in some fire hydrants and sprinklers in order to protect his ranch. This seemed like a good plan; however, when he needed to activate his new system he realized that they cut the power and thus made his setup useless when he needed it most.
  <br><br>
With all of these catastrophic events within the article, it was nice to see some people adapting to the current situation. Jay Ruskey realized that he could not maintain his avocado farm with the water situation, so he decided to become more diverse in what he grows in order to maintain a steady income.




</p><hr>


<p>

One particular aspect of “2°C: Beyond the Limit” that stood out to me was its focus on local farmers in Santa Barbara. As someone unfamiliar with the area, I had no idea how farmers were such a big part of the population here and I had never really considered how our society’s food producers would suffer in the effects of climate change. I was very interested in how they began to switch their crops to drought-friendly ones and stopped growing more water intensive avocados. However, somehow the article’s focus seems misguided.
  <br><br>
I had assumed that Santa Barbara would have had troubles enacting change due to its transient student population, but I did not know about local business interests impacting environmental regulation. How much can a reduction in parking even affect the environment though? Cars flow through the area because downtown SB is a giant strip of stores and restaurants. I think increasing the efficacy of the SBMTD would also be a good solution to encourage less driving. Adding more stops and more buses might reduce the need for free parking. 
  <br><br>
I think that a bigger issue is that there are MULTIPLE oil rigs right off the coast. For the city that is known for its environmental history, even seeing those rigs are a huge shock. Why is a proposal for expansion even being considered? The monetary aspect to climate change is terrifying. Additionally, I think the focus should not be placed on people for not being prepared. Obviously, preparation in the event of emergencies is important, but we need to talk about how electricity companies have obligations to update their equipment instead of turning off the power, which can be so dangerous for many people, like those hooked up to medical equipment.



</p><hr>


<p>
Now it might just be me, but I would prefer not to burn to death while I sleep in my seemingly safe room. Selfish as though it may sound, I would prefer us all to eat less McDonalds and square up on some more vegetable meals instead if it meant the continuation of keeping our local environment sound. That is if you can even call it sound in its current condition. As I write this, I can point to a burnt mountain side, the hundreds of "we're in a drought" signs in the bathrooms on campus, and the dead seal that's been steadily sitting on campus point for about 3 weeks now. It's just a shame to watch the beautiful natural landscape that lies in front of us slowly burn away or be trashed to the point of becoming a new, less hospitable ecosystem. 
  <br><br>

Whether it's all of us letting our diets do what they want, letting trash fall away into the streets, letting ourselves drive too often, letting ourselves overindulge and live in unsustainable ways, or even letting ourselves blow through 5 single use plastic puff bars in a week, it's safe to say that none of this is worth the sacrifice of our world. This is easy to keep in mind when you see something like our own personal world, i.e. Santa Barbara, burning down.

I totally agree with your perspective of the current situation of the local conditions.I believe that our main problem with the climate crisis is the ongoing laziness and lack of the general population to make any real change. The examples you brought up in your response are only some of the clear signs around at here at UCSB. The bottomline is that this issue is caused by us and with just a bit of change can be dramatically reduced with a majority of the populations participation. The current state of SB is only one of the many signs around us and should be eye-opening for all of us.

Reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit,” the most striking fact that caught my attention is how Ventura ranks as the fastest-warming county in the lower 48 states. I know that climate change is everywhere and will affect every spot on this planet, but it is terrifying that climate scientists say we need to keep global temperature averages under 2º and Ventura has already surpassed that mark. The scariest part is knowing that the warmer the Santa Barbara and Ventura counties get, the more frequent this area is going to experience extreme fires.
   <br><br>

The other shocking news was reading about the farmers having to change their crops because the crops cannot withstand climate change. Even Larry Saarloos, who thought he adapted well enough to save his crops and livestock by implementing new alarms and sprinklers to his ranch, failed when he tried to turn the new systems on to prevent his ranch from catching on fire. I think this is a telling tale: because human made climate change is happening now and humans haven’t lived through an extreme climate change in the past, we don’t know how to protect and prevent areas from harm. Even when we think we are adapting in the right way, there will always be a new curveball. The only way to know is to learn through the change.

While reading the article, “2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT,” the fire that happened last Thanksgiving was the first thing that made a spark in my head. I still remember that day very clearly, how I felt so terrified and scared because I’ve never seen anything like that before. I thought I could imagine what a wildfire is and how destructive it would be, but when it actually happen in front of my own eyes, there’s nothing I could compare it to. It is also from that point, I understood how desperate we are on finding solutions to slow down climate change. I personally don’t think stopping climate change is possible, even if we shut down every single carbon emission source, the effect of climate change will still last for several decades. However, I do believe there’s a lot we can do to slow it down and reduce the damage it could cause in the future. Right now, we are clearly not working hard enough. 
   <br><br>

One other thing I learned was that we are more willing to make changes and treating this issue more seriously when something happens in our own backyard. Because when I was back in LA, I feel like climate change was so far away, it’s something I only read in the newspaper.

This article helped me realize that because climate change has caused such an irregular pattern of weather, farmers have having huge trouble trying to predict what type of weather they are going to receive every year. In the article we learn about multiple farmers here in Santa Barbra who have been directly affected by these horrible changes in weather. It just goes to show that climate change is real and it is in our face! From one farmer having to switch from avocado to agave because of droughts to horrifically hot weather causing livestock of another farmer to be killed and orchards to be burned. This article is filled with multiple facts about how climate change is affecting our beautiful county. At times it was very difficult to read because it just felt like the author just kept on piling problem after problem but now I am ready to find out some solutions.



</p><hr>


<p>
Just like others I thought the climate crisis was important but it just did not affect me. My freshman year the Thomas fire was in full blaze. Because I do not recall ever being effected by a forest or brush fire, I saw it as a new experience. But when I Found out that this fire was the catalyst of the mudslides that had killed 23 people, I was surprised. I had thought I lived in a relatively safe part of the world. When I looked into the history of Santa Barbara these were extreme occurrences. In reality I faced the consequences of climate change first hand.
   <br><br>
Now I know that this is a real and pressing issue that should not be ignored. Santa Barbara was affected by climate change yet the county does not realize that their dealings with pro CO2 corporations such as big oil and the need for parking will keep things turning for the worse. I do believe that no one wants their quality of life to depreciate. but the greater cost will be passed along to all people on the earth.




</p><hr>


<p>

The article showed a lot of concerning facts. I remember watching a video about how the server of an impact there would be if the temperature of the earth has increased by 2 degrees Celsius. And I am surprised to see that the local temperature change in Santa Barbara have increased 2.3 degree Celsius over only decades. A higher risk of fire and a trend of showing fewer rains and more server fire combines with the documentary about wildfire in Paradise, I was worried.
   <br><br>
After watching the “Fire in Paradise”, it concerns me that living in Santa Barbara, where am I suppose to go, what am I suppose to do when similar things happen here? There were some wild-fire occurred in mountains nearby, and the road out of this area is narrow and surrounded by trees. Taking a boat out into the sea may just be the right way to evacuate. But from the article, although I know there is much more to be done, by all of us, I feel more ease by actions already taken by Santa Barbara county: New alarms, evacuation plans, backup generators can be used when scheduled power shutdown occur to decrease the risk of fire etc. 
   <br><br>
At the same time it pains me to see, although no totally unexpected, politicians are still promoting things that can cause climate change; are still denying the existence of climate changes even today, after finding evidence shown that many tragics such as wildfire is related to climate change.
   <br><br>
Wild-fire is never the only problem climate change has caused. The article showcases many bad consequences such as effects on sea animals. This is the scary part of climate change, you never know what kind of impacts it brings, you don’t know how slow or fast it affects us, but you know more black swan events like this will happen since the climate is so closely related to all livings. Climate change is not something that is fatal immediately, it poisons all of us slowly giving us false securities until the fire finally comes and burns.

“2°C: Beyond the Limit” was a very eye opening article. It showed you the truth of the Santa Barbara politics as well as the environmental movement. It’s crazy to think that a progressive city like SB is doing so little to combat climate change. What really blew me away is that rather than meeting the goals that SB had set, the greenhouse gas emissions of SB actually increased. Although, it’s easy to see how politicians and the business sector can be swayed, they should really think about what will happen to the entire city of SB if things keep going the way they are. 

   <br><br>

The oil drilling that continues to take place on the coast of SB is also a very pressing matter. For some reason I thought that the students of UCSB would some day have enough power to stop the drilling that's taking place in our own backyards. However, after reading this article I realize that the oil industry has so much more power than I thought. Even after a huge oil spill they continue to drill oil off the coast of SB. At this point I can only be hopeful that some change will take place in my lifetime.

I agree with you that this article was extremely eye-opening and set into perspective how this city is actually handling the climate crisis. In all honesty, I was naïve before receiving the flood of information the article provided; what I pictured as environmentally progressive, energy conservative Santa Barbara was replaced with evidence of political stalling, big business domination, and crumbling coastlines. I also was concerned when I was informed that the city is still considering pursuing oil projects, despite the monumental harm oil has done not only to our marine life, but the planet in general. I am disappointed every time I glance out at the ocean  view and am snapped back into reality by the oil rigs in the distance. How much more convincing do we have to do after the 1969 spill that shook the foundations of this region’s environmental consciousness? We surpassed our 2 degree Celsius mark, and are continuing to amplify the problem with new parking constructions and a luxurious tourist industry. I’m not sure how much damage will be done until the signs are taken seriously, and I hope our student population can bring awareness to that.

The issue that “Beyond the limit” addressed is relatable to us. The mountain fire in California is always a nightmare to all of us. I remember Thomas fire in 2017. The sky was red, the air is full of ashes and we had to wear masks outdoor. When I stepped outside, my tears fell off immediately because the ashes hurt my eyes so bad. What a terrifying time. That was the first time I felt as helpless as people to the mountain fire. During that time, the freeway was closed because of the fire or the flood caused by the storm rain. The paradise became the hell just over a night. It never occurred to me that our pollution emission is one of the factors that caused the disaster until I read the article. The author mentioned about the increasing pollution emission in Santa Barbara, as a student in UCSB, I think it is an alarm to us. I drive to school everyday and I am aware of that now. I should take bus or carpool with my roommate. Even though it may not change much to our environment, but at least it worth a try.

The article “2 C: Beyond the limit” describes how the rise in average temperature affects the earth.  A 2 degree rise may not seem like much to each individual person, but it significantly changes the environment.  The climate gets hotter, and the forests become more dry.  It has caused deadly fires and mudslides.  In addition, crops have been dying, forcing farmers to find new crops.  One effect that I have seen first hand is the erosion of the cliffs on Del Playa.  Many of the cliffs are held up by large pillars, I constantly see warnings about the erosion.  We must try to stop the rise of average temperature, or else Del Playa disappear in the coming decades.

This is true. I think the article does a good job at showing the effects climate change is already having on the environment, and I think for students at UCSB, it shows us that the effects are closer to us than we think. It's eye opening to think about the fact that this is only the beginning of the effects and that the future holds consequences even more severe and more widespread, not just for hot areas and coastal areas, but for the world at large.

I found this article to be eyeopening. I am in my second year of UCSB, and I consider this place to be very special for me. It scares me to think that by 2060, 78% of Del Playa could be eroded, that by 2060, there will be no DP to roam around, looking for beach side parties. What I got from this article is that we are not doing enough to make a difference, even though we promised that we would. The article talks about how even though the County promised in 2015 to reduce greenhouse emissions by 15 percent compared to 2007 levels, by 2017, Santa Barbara was actually exceeding 2007 levels. Since 1895, the average temperature of the Santa Barbara County has increased by 2.3 degrees Celsius, neighboring county Ventura has increased its average temperature since pre-industrial days by 2.6 degrees Celsius, these average temperatures exceeds the threshold of under 2 degrees Celsius worldwide in the 2015 Paris Agreement. There are many consequences of this temperature rise, such as our eroding cliffs, the recent fires, etc. How much does the people of the county have to suffer before a change has been made?

This week’s reading, just as the film, hit very close to home. It described the climate crisis as a local issue, one that is occurring in real time, in our backyards. Beginning the article with, “Santa Barbara, Calif. - When the fire came this time...” is what caught my attention right away. Before this class, I wasn’t fully aware of the effects the climate crisis had on me specifically. Sure, I understood that the concepts of world warming, the ice caps melting, and wildfires increasing were its negative effects, but I never before asked myself how this was going to affect me. This article started with a first hand report of a climate change destruction; the Real Fire. Terri Bowman, a local camping resort manager, explained the evacuation of her campground as the smoke appeared above the canyon walls. She reported the speed in which her staff acted as well as how used to this kind of event they have become. In Southern California, everyday life is transforming; the climate is growing drier, hotter, and windier. The article explains that this is what has been fueling the increasing cases of intense wildfires, leading to mudslides and our prolonged drought. The article then transitions into accusing Santa Barbara County of, “...falling short of their own anti-pollution goals, which are meant to serve as a model for others to follow.” It explains how its government has shifted away from the interests of local businesses and supporters of environmental regulation. The city’s legacy was built on its progressiveness towards environmental matters, and this article argues that it is not as progressive as we believe. 
<br><br>
I think it's pretty significant that I was reading this article while sitting on the Pacific Surfliner heading home to Orange County. The article first claims that the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean are slowly disappearing with the rising sea levels caused by climate change. To think that my possible home on Del Playa in the next three years, could be gone in twenty, is insane. Obviously I won’t be living there anymore, but what about the generations of future UCSB students that are coming next? This article really made me think about my contribution to the climate crisis as well as my future and the future of my children.



</p><hr>


<p>

After reading the article entitled “2 Degrees: Beyond the Limit” by Scott Wilson it has really changed my perspective on the climate crisis as a whole. I believe that the majority of people who do not believe in climate change think that way because they have not had to experience it first hand. But as shown in the article, the people in California have really been feeling the change these past couple of years. There has been so much change in such a short period of time, that farmers are having to grow different crops so that they can continue to make a livelihood. This story seems to hit even closer to UCSB students because of the erosion that has happened on the cliff side of Del Playa Drive. It is believed that in the next twenty to thirty years, many of the homes may be condemned because it will become too dangerous for anyone to live in them.

Growing up in Southern California and living not very far from Santa Barbara made this article a lot more alarming than I had expected. I found it odd that there was no general scientific consensus as to why the Ventura County area was warming so much more rapidly than other areas in the U.S. This seems interesting because if we are aware of the problems that cause climate change, like we presume to know, then what is so inherently different about this region that is creating such quicks spikes in temperature rise? It seems to me like people are ignoring the problem and the answers to questions like this because it simply doesn't affect enough people. 
<br><br>

On another note, I found it interesting that people who live within the areas discussed in Santa Barbara do not seem to care about improving the state of the county they live in. The statistic that showed that emissions should have decreased 15 % back to 2007 standards but instead showed a 14 % increase in emissions was staggering. The regulations will surely have to be changed to form much more strict rules that can actually reform the situation that is unfolding before us. If there is no change the luxurious area of Santa Barbara seems to be doomed to serve as an example as a county that failed to improve its situation before it ultimately ceased to effective support citizens.

The reading, 2 degrees Beyond the Limit, I was exposed to the issues occurring throughout all of California. From the central valley, I would hear about the fires occurring near Santa Barbara on the news. Reading this article exposed me to the harsh reality that we are facing today, a relity in which every town or county is affected by the changing temperatures. The article dives into many aspects such as relaying information and describing how people are adapting to the changing environments. Personally, I find it sad how we are forced into adapting to the climates because the issue of climate change is so ingrained into the climate that there is no way to reverse the effects that humanity has been adding to since the start of the industrial revolution. Like mentioned in the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” humanity is barely paying a debt accumulated over time. The article shows the reality in which in order to survive the heating temperatures one has to adapt or one can move cities or counties.

<p>
Before reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit”, I wasn’t fully aware of the effects of climate change we are facing here in California, specifically in our own Santa Barbara County and Ventura County. I knew from a previous geography course I took at UCSB that our coastline is prone to flooding due to the rising sea level. I didn’t know that Santa Barbara County warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius and Ventura County warmed by 2.6 degrees Celsius, ranking as the fastest-warming county in the United States. Both of the counties already exceeded the threshold set by the 2015 Paris climate accords and are already facing some consequences.
<br><br>

A prime example of consequences to the rising temperature is the dangers of fires in the Santa Barbara County. Only two years ago was the Thomas Fire, one of the largest fires in California, that burned down the hillsides and caused heavy damage to the land and people surrounding it. I find it embarrassing that even though Santa Barbara is regarded as the birthplace of the new environmental movement, its people still struggle to follow goals to create a cleaner environment. The local government here is willing to push bills to regulate the population more but they are ineffective in their reforms as local businesses and the oil industry are opposed to change. I think it’s up to Santa Barbara County to set an example and become an advocate to the rest of California by pushing new green initiatives.



</p><hr>


<p>
In response to the lecture, I feel that I know this is happening and I agree with what the article has informed me about various subjects. Though Ventura being the fastest-warming county in 48 states had really come as a surprise to me, I didn't much have a lot of number sense on these types of statistics. 
 <br><br>
In regards to what the article said, one of the things that caught my attention is that there was no mention of the less wealthy communities that also occupy Montecito, which really made me wonder that if the had indeed caused $2 billion in damage or way more (since there wasn't any source on how this damage was calculated). 
<br><br>
 Another topic that really stood out to me was the talk on the water running out and the fact that people take water for granted and never realize it is running out. But what about the Chumash communities, who have been fighting for their water rights ever since colonization? What about their perspective on UCSB taking their water? Their rights? Their land? UCSB, Goleta, Santa Barbara all occupy Chumash land, as well as tribes that were not federally recognized because the government doesn't want to allocate reservations to these tribes. 
<br><br>
 One other thing that stood out is the mention of tar on the beach. Though I agree fossil fuel industry should completely be abolished (unless I completely misunderstood the article) but much of the tar on SB beaches are naturally occurring (https://goletahistory.com/tar/). 
<br><br>
 Lastly, much like all environmental agreements/plans/deals, there was no enforcer for SB Climate Action Plan. As the same happened with Paris Agreement and the Green New Deal. Everyone can still do nothing and face no human enforced consequence but the destruction of this earth. And people continue to make these agreements but what else can environmentalists do when climate deniers are present everywhere. 
<br><br>
Finally, some of the things I learned include some of the powerlines shut down from PG&E stopped farmers like Saarloos from saving their home and produce. I don't know if there is a solution to folks living in high fire risk areas and if the government will subsidize these people the generator they need to survive.

Similar to Fire in Paradise, this article takes an approach that's deeply personal and close to home. Rather than talking about abstract consequences that's in many ways detached from the reader, this article demonstrates the effects of climate change on individuals in this community. Coming from Florida, I was really surprised how seemingly progressive Santa Barbara was. Since I decided to drive from Florida to California, I got to stop by hotels in the states along the way. The hotels in Santa Barbara were the only ones to remind the guests to conserve water. Additionally, compared to my city in Florida, Santa Barbara just seems to be much more conscious regarding this issue. Therefore, I was really disappointed to see the article's evaluation of Santa Barbara's lack of effort in tackling climate change. Despite its environmentally friendly reputation, Santa Barbara struggles to live up to its goals because of their lack of commitment. While it's slightly disappointing that the city I'm living in isn't as environmentally friendly as it claims to be, it's severely concerning to me what this means for the other cities in the world. If a progressive and environmentally conscious city is struggling with its commitment, how can other less environmentally friendly places succeed in their goals. 
<br><br>


It's really saddening how the issue of climate change is barely prioritized when it comes to decisions that will actually cost people. Santa Barbara will gladly advocate for environmentally friendly policies except when it comes at the expense of the convenience of citizens  and the profit of corporations. I think people need to recognize that true change will entail and cost a lot more than words or activism.

I agree that it is disappointing to see that the city that claims to be environmentally friendly is actually not doing enough to prove this status. But what is more depressing, in my opinion, is how many cities actually are aware of climate change and advocate for environmentally friendly policies. From where I am from, for example, the government has just started to put recycle bins on the streets, but even that does not help, since everything that has been thrown away in the recycle bins was put in the bins with the regular trash. This has caused a lot of talk and criticism towards the government and the reality of the climate change policies it has passed, but in the end, no changes had happened. 
<br><br>
This kind of situation that involves so much negligence from so many people happens everywhere around the world, and it is very alarming and makes me think whether we actually have what it takes to stop climate change.

I was aware that Santa Barabara had some incidents with muslides because of the rain and cliffs, but I did not know much of the various fires that occurred in Santa barbara until I started as a student here. I was surprised that the article mentions that the fires have occurred more frequently and that fire season is year round now.  I found very concerning and disappointing when the article stated  that Santa Barabra said it would reduce the greenhouse emission by fifteen percent, but rather than do that the amount emitted actually increased by fourteen percent. I was aware that UCSB tried to be environmentally friendly and advocated for cause such as keeping the beach clean and protecting sea turtles, but the fact still is that it seems enough is not being done in Santa Barbara to lead by example. It is unfair to expect so much from one city, but change must start somewhere so why not here. In the article it that a report claimed that by, “erosion could claim up to 78 percent of the city’s bluffside beaches by 2060”,which is concerning since I  already see various warning sides of unstable buffsides by beaches. I agree with the point made in the article that mentions that one of  the problems is  that there is no regulation of businesses and no consequences for their actions. Another problem is that the oil industry still holds lots of power and influence that prevents the work that organisations fighting for renewable energy and to stop against oil drilling. I think until more public support is given to organizations fighting for the climate crisis and for stricter regulations for industries/ business contributing to the crisis nothing will really change.  Also I think having citation throughout the article would have made the article stronger and added credibility. I was not sure where the information provided in the article was coming from. There were several compelling arguments so having citations would have made the points even more influential.

Wow! When reading Beyond The Limit, I was shocked to read that Ventura county’s temperature rose 2.6 degrees. Now 40 million residents in California are living in areas prone to fires or heat storms. Recently Ventura had a tornado hit its arbor, which is very odd because tornadoes usually don’t occur in these areas. This shows that temperatures are rising and climate change is happening. I am worrried about what is going on and I hope things can improve. 
 <br><br>
 According to Scott Wilson, the author of this article, “Santa Barbara’s heritage as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, the county is falling far short of its own anti-pollution goals, which are meant to serve as a model for others to follow. The failure has activists here wondering: If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?” This is a very important question that needs to be answered because even the President of the United States is hestitant to help because he himself is skeptical of the climate crisis. If the leader of the free world cannot help us, we must unite and change our ways for the better if we want the current state of the planet to improve. According to Wilson, “ the government here has bumped up against local business interests, from downtown retailers and restaurants to the oil industry, that oppose more environmental regulation and even such seemingly minor changes to civic life as a reduction in downtown parking. Those interests are often decisive in determining local elections.”

The rise in temperature is rapidly affecting the coastal environment as well as the marine life. Majority of the world's population lives on or within a close proximity of the ocean and so with the depletion of water and wildlife. It's not news that all these wildfires, flooding, and drought is all happening all at once. In fact, the more that it happens, the less people listen. It's like they've succumbed to the tragedies that they don't even see them as tragedies. According to the article, a quarter of California's population resides in high risk fire zones, but how many of them are actually prepared for these disasters. Don't get me wrong. I'm part of that group who's not entirely prepared for wildfires because I didn't think it would happen near my hometown and while we were not forced to evacuate, it was an eye opener, but I felt that my community was stunned for a short period of time, and then they completely forget about it. No further action was taken. Then the cycle starts over. It's that mentality that if it doesn't happen to you, then it's not your problem- simple as that. It's one thing to read these events on paper and another to actually experience it. We definitely need to take safety precautions locally as well as globally.

When I was little, I would visit my family friends in Santa Barbara once in a while. I fell in love with the weather here, and the weather played a huge part in my decision to come to UCSB. I remember them telling me that “Santa Barbara never gets hot, and it only rains maybe 5 days out of the year.” The article talked about the crazy temperature surge on July 6, 2018. Coincidentally, that day was my Freshman orientation. Everyone was sweating, dying of thirst, and it did not even cool down a bit at night. I panicked and thought maybe this kind of heat would continue. Thankfully, it did not. Additionally, I remember that it rained so much Winter Quarter of 2019 - perhaps 2 or 3 weeks straight. Combined with recent serious events such as the Thomas Fire, climate change is undoubtedly happening. The climate is now sporadic, unpredictable, and more dangerous than it has ever been.
 <br><br>
I would like to point out that I think the concept of “Global Weirding” is a lot more appropriate than the term “Global Warming”. The world is not just getting hotter, but it is also getting extreme blizzards, colder in some areas, droughts, and floods. 
 <br><br>
This article made me realize that climate change is not something that happens somewhere else in the world, but it happens right where I live. I can’t imagine 20 or 30 years from now - will Del Playa Drive even be there? Will there be complications regarding water levels in IV?

The article 2°C: Beyond the Limit shows that wildfire has become frequent since 2016 in California. The originally mild weather is hotter and hotter. It mentions the average temperature increases 2.3 degrees Celsius in Santa Barbara. When I see Santa Barbara is in the dark red area of California  map of the temperature change, I feel the fear intuitively. Just where we study and live is experiencing the most direct change caused by climate. In the context of the world, it doesn't feel that way. But when it comes down to this close, the feeling is both immediate and intense. Before last Thanksgiving, there was a fire near campus in Santa Barbara. That was the first time I was so close to wildfire. As an international student, I only saw the news about wildfires before. In the video, the camera on the car recorded the fire on the mountain in front of the highway. People tried to get out of here, but the fire closed the road. I could even see the fire in the dormitory that day. The raging fire in the mountains was both spectacular and frightening. After the fire died out, the smoke billowed from the mountain as if a volcano had just erupted. This personal experience taught me that climate change is happening right around the corner. Weird events happening around the world during this time are a constant reminder to humanity. Santa Barbara, as a pioneer place of the modern environmental movement, should do its part. We as people living here should do what we should do.

<p>

After reading the article, I realized that temperature rise which is higher than 2 degrees is a signal to us. It reminds us that we need to pay more attention to the climate change around us. I always heard about the fire that caused by dry weather and forests in California from the news or TV when I was studying in China.  Maybe it was a little bit far from me, so I did not have any strong feelings about this.But I am now a student in UCSB, and in November, I saw the fire which was only 16 miles away from my campus. From the point of my dorm, I could see the whole process clearly. However, when other students were “exciting “ to post photos and videos on ins or moments, I was really concerned. The reason behind it was that I know clearly that many citizens need to move to other safe regions, and it also influenced the air quality and growth of plants.
 <br><br>

I am come from a city called Kunming in China. To be honest, it almost the driest city in China. Due to dry climate and high temperature, fire also always happens. People always think that Kunming is a comfortable city for people to live, but in this moment, everything changes. The climate change influenced my city deeply. I am continue considering what can I do for this beautiful city.  Taking bus instead of driving cars, using less air conditioners, or utilizing less water? Those things are definitely not enough to change the current situation.
 <br><br>

The people around whole world should pay more attention to the climate change. Although many conflicts and arguements are still existing between every country. Climate change is the thing that we need to be a union. The power of one person, one city, one country is limited, but the power of whole world is unlimited. The climate has already sent us the signal of seriousness. We need to catch this information and consider in detail about what we can do for preventing climate change.

This article was another piece of information that informed me just how severe the climate crisis is. I used to believe that we weren’t in much danger and that we were going to be safe for a long time, but I realized that we are already at the point where we have carbon gas emissions that are way too much and we need to act as soon as possible to slow them down. I still remember, when I was five years old, I used to go outside into the backyard with my parents and spend five to ten minutes looking up at the stars. That used to be such a peaceful moment that I cherish to this day and it also helped me get much closer to my parents because I could spend that time just with them and not worry about school or work. Now, I rarely see stars in the sky because of pollution and that saddens me because then other kids won’t get to have the same opportunities that I had when I was a kid. I hope that we can let everyone know that the climate crisis is here and motivate them to take action immediately because we need to change this for not only us but also our future descendants.

Despite being the birthplace of Earth day and the modern environmental movement, Santa Barbara has yet to live by our own ideas and continue to harm the environment. I think it was important for the article to highlight the changes occurring locally in order to demonstrate the reality of the climate crisis. There is often a disconnect between the climate crisis and our community as it seems like a distant problem regarding time and space. This then leads to a lack of action. The article also discussed how Santa Barbara and Ventura have exceeded the 2 degree Celsius threshold which explains the natural disasters and what some call “global weirding” in the area. Our area is being significantly affected by the climate crisis, with events like the Thomas Fires and coastal erosion, that make it impossible to ignore the issue. I also liked the fact that the video mentioned the fact that the climate crisis affects more than just the environment. The article, “2°C: Beyond the limit”, discusses how some environmental changes have impacted the local farms and orchards. Societal and economic effects will be felt in the near future as more farms are impacted, possibly leading to food shortages and regional economic decline as they lose business. The climate crisis has such a large-scale impact on our society that I believe needs more recognition as it’s not just getting a little warmer outside, our planet is changing.

While reading this article I was astonished to hear about the effects the fires have had on Ventura and Santa Barbara. I grew up in Santa Paula, which is where the Thomas fire started and I remember the lack of coverage or even care that was being directed to these people. Santa Paula is home to many low income and or people of color. As we have stated before, the people who are often left to be uncared for are people with less power, money and resources. It took the fire affecting places like Ventura and Santa Barbara to make the news and to get people to listen and help those being affected. The crazy weather that we have seen in California is telling of the climate crisis we are in. From California being in a drought to sideways rain, and having classes cancelled because of bad air quality due to the fires, we are already seeing the effects. However, since people are not educated on the severity of it all, and because they don't know how to change their habits, we continue in a cycle where nobody changes and is ignorant to the problem. I think most of the lack of change comes from the lack of knowledge on the vegetarian diet and ways that we are able to change our habits and make a difference. Another issue is how ingrained meat and consumerism has been ingrained into Americans that we always rationalize the damage we are doing by thinking that one person doesn't have much of an impact but it always starts with just one person.

From the beginning, Scott Wilson grasped my attention and gave me first-person insights into dangerous SoCal weather. The fact that the campsite was so well run and had an emergency action plan shows that at least some people are well aware of the climate changes we are facing and will continue to face if nothing changes. I was particularly alarmed by the fact that the coastal curve from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles to San Diego and the Mexican Borders are all warming at double the rate of the continental US, and it is only getting worse. 

 <br><br>

As a recreational scuba diver who loves all ocean creatures I was disheartened to read that thirteen whales washed up in San Francisco. Additionally, many of their stomachs were found empty due to the dying kelp forests (from our human action). 

 <br><br>

Further down the article Scott discussed the fires and how that affects individuals’ lives. Without a home and possessions, lots of insurance questions, etc. it is a very unfortunate situation to be in. What is worse is that it was human action that contributed and continues to contribute to extreme and dangerous climate patterns. As citizens, policy makers, and people who claim to “not care” about any issues--we need to bind together and make changes because the climate crisis isn’t an issue to take sides on, it’s important for all of us and the future of our species.

I was also alarmed that the coastal curve from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles to San Diego and the Mexican Borders are all warming at double the rate of the continental US and the idea that it can only get worse from here is scary. I was also very surprised to hear that Santa Barbara and Ventura are heating up so fast. It is sad that these areas have already surpassed the limit set by the Paris agreement. This was shocking to hear because all along I thought Santa Barbara was actually taking care of the environment that surrounds us students. The people in charge make It seem like they care by keeping policies like having a smoke free county but there are more important issues to deal with. The continuous pumping of oil is further contributing to the problems we face today and what is ironic is that the oil being pumped from Santa Barbara is going to help make parts of Santa Barbara inhabitable in the future. 
 <br><br>

The other part of this reading that I found particularly interesting was the segment that discussed the erosion of del playa cliffs and properties. This caught me off guard because I had not associated this with climate change at all. I simply thought of this as a normal occurrence and now that I think about it this same problem is occurring in my home town near Los Angeles.

What I once thought as a very green and eco-friendly place turned out to be far from the truth. As Leah Stokes, a political science professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, says, “In our own backyard, we are not nearly as progressive as we think.” And she is very true. Until I read this article I wasn’t aware of the different components and dynamics that make up the environmental state of Santa Barbara. Not only do industrys like downtown retailers, restaurants, and oil companies contribute heavily to the problem but they also contribute at the source. These industries have the influence and power to affect public elections and, therefore, influence what laws are passed that would help their companies, yet hurt the very neighborhood that Santa Barabara residents were once able to see as a place that wasn’t hypocritical of the very actions they partake in. To contribute to the alarmist attitudes that were present in last weeks readings and lectures, unless something is done, the sea views we cherish every day will succumb to the effects of erosion and we will lose up to 78% of the bluffside beaches by 2060.

I think that the article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" did an excellent job at highlighting that climate change is here and reeking havoc on Santa Barbara county. I though it was a smart move to include the anecdotes of residents because it allows the reader to get a transparent first hand insight on the impact climate has on a community. Many residents feel helpless when they are matched with mother nature. Regardless of the efforts the individual may take in order to protect themselves from the damages that come with these unprecedented natural disasters. This was highlighted with the farmer who invested 100,000 dollars into protecting his ranch with no avail because of a electrical fail due to the debris and smoke caused by the fire.

 <br><br>

Seeing Santa Barbara claim that they want to help the climate crisis and protect their residents while also debating to expand their oil extraction further north is infuriating. This is a pattern that is recognized by the United States as a whole. We can not expect change while we prioritize profits over protection. We need to realize that the amount of wealth that we accumulate by hurting the planet will be short lived if we do not take action to ensure there is a sustainable tomorrow.

 <br><br>

I think the article lacked the point of view of less fortunate residents within the county. The focus of the article were ranch owners that were able to invest within their properties in order to survive these detrimental events. Many people that do not have the same resources and representation will suffer and are currently suffering at a larger scale. I think by showing this it would give a more realistic approach to the issue.

Climate change is a pressing issue that is honestly scary. Knowing that California but more specifically Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have gone up in temperature is scary. These temperatures have done and will continue to have bad consequences. Many people thought and maybe still think that the most pressing issue in California, coastal areas is the rising sea levels. These fires have done so much damage thus far and will only continue to be get more destructive. The drought problem in California will continue which means the fire problem will only continue to increase. The drought and fires are putting a huge toll on the agriculture here. Now people who do not believe in climate change will start to see that it is happening and it is affecting California.
 <br><br>
 California is known for its “great” weather, now it’s being known for its drought and fires. This issue will only continue to grow as the fires will continue. The 2 degrees Celsius: Beyond the limit talks about the Thomas fire. I was a freshman at the time and saw it firsthand. I remember seeing the ash falling down which looked like snow. I remember having to wear a mask and the mob of people wearing masks in order to take finals before they got cancelled. I was able to see the fire from my dorm room and vividly remember the emergency alters on my phone. I vividly remember the smell of the fire and the way the sky looked. I still panic a little when I get emergency alters because I think we are getting an alter to evacuate. The fires will continue and it is something that will not be able to be stopped. Climate change is affecting where we live and will continue to destroy land which is not ours to destroy in the first place and the livelihood of many. I can’t imagine what will happen in the future

The reading "Beyond the Limit" does a excellent job of expressing the direness of the climate crisis and showing how peoples lives are already being impacted. The fact that Ventura county, which is only about an hour down the coast, is the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states is both shocking and terrifying. I grew up in Ventura and to hear that farms are having to switch their crops for the first time in generations is heartbreaking. When I was little I would often here the adults talking about the drought and how all their orchards were struggling but I never fathomed the severity of the problem in Ventura county until I read this article. For us UCSB students though we have been able to witness first hand how climate change is affecting our coasts. Since day one we couldn't walk along the beach with out little bits of the cliffs breaking off and trickling down the netting meant to hold them back. Its devastating that in 50 years or less UCSB students will be living in a entirely different Isla Vista.

Much like the readings that were presented before “2ºC: Beyond the Limit” offers a brand new perspective of how climate change is already affecting us in our local communities. The reading brought a very personal and heartbreaking feeling for me, as it discussed climate issues in places such as Santa Barbara and Ventura. As a UCSB student, the article almost made me feel like the destructive nature of climate change that we have been learning about is not somewhere else, but right in our backyard. These are consequences that are happening right now, with growing temperature rates of 2C in the county of Ventura.

One point made in the article that was very surprising was that Santa Barbara was falling short of their anti pollution laws. Learning that Santa Barbara is not only raising his carbon emissions, but developing more and investing on its personal interests rather than caring about the environment that we need to preserve. This development is not only disastrous for the air, but for the cliffs that are slowly crumbling due to the rising sea level. Last month, I heard of a story of the balcony was lost due to the eroding of sand under it. Our sea level is only going to grow, and due to our increasing climate it could cause terrible effects for people and coasts of Isla vista. Not only water level, but events such as the spontaneous tornado that hit near the Santa Barbara area is a growing concern for residents and needs practical and effective solutions.

I find it scary that we live in an area that is becoming rather volatile. Living next to the water is very assuring though knowing that we have some distance between us and the areas that are prone to fires. The biggest factor to consider on-campus is will we ever face a tornado as mentioned in the video.

After reading Scott Wilson’s article “2°C: Beyond the limit,” I feel surprised that Santa Barbara released such a lot of pollution. I always think that we did a great job in protecting the environment. We take the bus or ride the bicycle to the college. But the report shows that, rather than reducing those emissions, Santa Barbara was exceeding its 2007 levels by 14 percent.
 <br><br>
In this article, a manager’s story left a deep impression in my mind. The manager Terri Bowman had prepared her for what had once been unthinkable in the past few years. She spent an amount of money to protect the canyon’s visitors’ safety. The only casualty was her bottom line. The fire almost become an annual event in California. “Life in Southern California, once as mild and predictable as the weather, is being transformed as the climate grows hotter, drier and in some regions windier, fueling more intense wildfires, deadly mudslides, and prolonged extreme drought.” Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius. Across California, the growing heat and loss of moisture threatens the iconic coastal redwood forests and the Joshua trees of the southern desert. Bird populations have been ravaged by drought, with several once-prominent desert habitats losing 43 percent of their species in the past century. Offshore, the warming ocean has depleted once-expansive kelp forests around the Channel Islands and has thrown oyster, crab, and urchin harvests into disarray. In Santa Barbara County, the dangers of this grave new world came into focus with the Thomas Fire in 2017. It was the largest in state history at the time, burning more than 281,000 acres. The torrent of earth killed 23 people. The fire and the steep hillsides caused more than $2 billion in damage and focused attention on the shifting climate. The remedies we did so far are mostly ineffective. 
 <br><br>
I think the author did a great job of explaining the severity of the climate in Santa Barbara. He interviews people, like professors, farmers, and students. He also cites statistical numbers from reports. This makes his article credible. As the author says, the remedies we did so far are mostly ineffective. But we still need to find a way that can slow down the speed of climate change. We need to make some effort in protecting the environment.

It was very interesting to read this article because usually when you see the news about fire evacuations, it does not seem as important or at least you do not clearly see the severity of it. However, while reading this article I felt preoccupied due to the closeness of Ventura county and now that I live in Santa Barbara, it worries me to know that Santa Barbara County itself has warmed up by about 2.3 degrees celsius, which already exceeds the Paris agreement held by Barack Obama back in 2015. It was believed that a 2 degree increase would be chaotic, yet we have not managed to control our greenhouse emissions, thus temperatures have increased drastically in the last decades. Along with this growing heat, species face a struggle to survive since their habitats are being destroyed or are now uninhabitable. Santa Barbara has shown in the last few years that their intentions to reduce greenhouse emissions are not being enforced. Santa Barbara County has actually exceeded the number of emissions and as Leah Stokes states, “we are not being progressive” at all. It scares me to think of all the houses along the shore and how in just a matter of time they won’t be there, can’t even imagine past generations coming back and realizing how much it has changed. Cliffs are falling down and houses will too.Everyone is being affected by the climate change. Due to the severe droughts, farmers have to switch into more tropical crops. It is frustrating that even with what has happened in Santa Barbara, environmentalists struggle to achieve any improvement toward greenhouse emissions regulations and have to support to enforce renewable sources. 
 <br><br>

I had no idea that the third-largest spill in US history had happened in Santa Barbara, and that I could be stepping on the tar that has been left since years ago. It is sad, but it’s true, we care more about “how it looks than how it lives”, we do not practice what we preach.

The beginning of the article left me with a sad mental image of coming back to visit UCSB in 2060 and seeing up to 78% of Del Playa eroded. The beaches and streets filled with trash, even more so than now. People have just given up on trying to do better because there was never an easy way to do it. I cringe at this image and try to shake it out of my head while still knowing that the future could definitely be like this, it could also not be as bad as it seems however it could also be much worse. 
 <br><br>

Last year I remember how late the "June gloom" stayed, and it reminded me that our seasons are tending to come later in the year. And I just know this isn't good for the climate. It makes fires more intense. Four of the five worst fire seasons of the past half century have burned in the last two decades. That's insane! We have been aware of the consequences of climate change for decades but yet we aren't preparing. Luckily some people take matters into their own hands and have their own evacuation plans with their neighborhoods in order to have social resilience when Authorities aren't adapting. 
 <br><br>

Santa Barbara seems mostly all talk and no walk when it comes to being environmentally conscious. The country conducts a full inventory of its greenhouse gas emission only once every three years and its Climate Action Plan imposes no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals. There's no grounding to this or anyone to enforce it so of course we are slacking majorly! My question now is why aren't we holding these businesses accountable? And how can we start doing that? It's not like we can put a business in jail so we have to think of something.

As recent events can attest to (Thomas Fire 2017, Australian Fire 2019, i.e), fires are becoming a more common natural disaster occurring not only in Santa Barbara, or even in California, but across the world. But focusing here in local Santa Barbara, it is evident that even with the county residents witnessing first-hand some of the effects that the climate crisis is having in there own lives, change is still moving at a snails pace. I find it disgusting to walk along the beach and return home with oil covering the entire bottom part of my foot. It dawned on me that a possible reason for this slowed pace of change is the inability to acknowledge future consequences and believe that they will affect you personally. The Thomas Fire in 2017 caused upwards of 2 billion dollars in damages and people are wondering why. If I could make an analogy on the situation: a person comes up with the rational that they don't need to spend their money on a tooth brush or tooth paste as they haven't experienced any dental problems, however, 10 years down the line and now there having to pay for expensive procedures to fix their rotting gums, ultimately costing them more in the long run. And I know theres a saying "hindsight is 2020", but when will people understand that we are already at the point of paying for past mistakes. History is a teacher, and us as the students are sitting in the back of the class not paying attention. 
 <br><br>

But it's good and all to talk about what has happened and what we can do about it, but real change is when there is action. I can say personally that I will never give up eating beef, chicken, or pork; but I also believe that I can consume less of it than I have in the past. Is it practical to be consuming as much meat as the typical American does, no. But is it also practical that everyone become a vegan, no. The idea of consuming meat products has become too interwoven in out modern day culture, but there is no reason why we all can't make personally compromises. An easy one to start with would be reducing your consumption of meat to twice or once a week. Change is hard to do when looking at the entire overall problem, and somewhat daunting as well; but creating smaller, more manageable steps reduces overarching shadow. I look forward to learning more in the rolling weeksvabout other changes that I can make in my own life to positively affect the climate crisis.

Although I am only a first-year, I’d like to say I consider Santa Barbara to be like a second home to me. I’ve grown to have a really special place in my heart for this area, and I am not ready to see this home get destroyed. The fact that both Santa Barbara County and Ventura County have already exceeded over 2°C of warming since 1895 should be extremely alarming, to citizens in these counties, but the article “2°C: Beyond the Limit” seemed to demonstrate that many people down here have very little urgency in fixing the problem. The Thomas Fire in 2017 brought the issue of climate change to the forefront of Santa Barbara’s problems, yet little action has been enacted in response. It really stood out to me when the article brought up the fact that Santa Barbara has been accused about valuing it’s looks over how it lives. Of course we all love to visit State Street, but as great as it is, sacrificing the stability of the climate in order to keep businesses and restaurants flourishing doesn’t seem like the smartest option. I’m not ready to see college students’ dream houses on Del Playa get eroded away; incoming classes for the next decades to come should be able to experience the Friday nights on the cliffs that so many of us Gauchos have gotten to. This is such a beautiful town, but none of us will be able to enjoy it don’t take the steps to stop ruining it. The article stated that cars are likely to top contributor to Santa Barbara County’s air pollution. As much as I want to bring my car to school with me here next year, I have to think about the carbon footprint I’d be making in an environment that’s already suffering. One student leaving their car at home might not make much of a positive impact, but it’s definitely making less of a negative one.

After reading the article “2°C: Beyond the limit”, as a international student from China, it is the first time that I feel the crisis of environment change that is right besides me. This article clearly informed its audience that the “dismal 2 degrees temperature change” has influence the live of people and local animals as well as forest. Though the place I used to live in China has not been influenced that much as Southern California, sandstorms caused by the depletion of the forests had been stoke my hometown for 2 years. 
 <br><br>

Also, when I first came to Santa Barbara, I found that it is such a nice place. Surprisingly, I never know that Santa Barbara area has been influenced by climate change that much until I read the article. Although some people started thinking some way to save themselves from upcoming disaster such as drought, the committee of Santa Barbara still plans a drilling program which could potentially harm the environment not saving it, which indicates that people are still lacking the awareness of saving the environment.

It is good and very interesting knowing the response of other intentional students so we know their perspective and view of climate charge. You were part of both countries that have contributed the most tp the production of CO2 and have experienced the climate climate change that continues to affect us. I agree with you that people are still lacking awareness here in Santa Barbara and instead we should educate them about climate change.

“2°C: Beyond the limit” did a wonderful job portraying the harsh reality of the climate crisis playing out in Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, and California as a whole. In all honesty, this article was a little bit disheartening because although Santa Barbara county has very enthusiastic and determined residents and leaders that want to tackle the climate crisis, the county as a whole hasn’t made any progressive measures to tackle this behemoth of a problem. I understand that the crisis won’t be fixed overnight, but it would mean a lot to the residents and the rest of the world if we became active in the fight against climate change and possibly set a precedent for the rest of California and hopefully for the rest of the world.
 <br><br>

I was born and raised in Berkeley, CA and throughout my childhood, I haven’t experienced temperatures there like I have been in these past few years. As a result of the high temperatures and no rain, Berkeley has been experiencing fires, much like the rest of California, which is something I have never really heard about when I was younger. Berkeley experienced triple-digit temperatures a couple of years ago in September when it’s normally around 74℉. I’m not sure if these specific incidents are directly linked to climate change or not, but it definitely makes you wonder. I believe this was a wake-up call that I needed because much like some others I also thought climate change was just some invisible entity that I wouldn’t have to worry about until later in life but now it has presented itself in my city. Due to this, I choose to be more conscious of my lifestyle choices, and I hope many others will also come to terms that the climate crisis isn’t near, but already here.

While reading the article, 2ºC: Beyond the limit, I was not very astonished at all. I believe fires have been going on around me for a while now. But, I have noticed that there has been an increase of fires since years ago. The past couple years since I have been at Santa Barbara, we have been hit with multiple fires. It is scary to see how fires are becoming more prevalent and normal; each and every fire burning more than the last. It is saddening to see all my family and friends evacuate in fear of their home and all their valuable belongings being burnt into flames. 
 <br><br>

One thing that you mentioned that was extremely frightening was the tornado warning that hit Santa Barbara during break. I remember I was up in Lake Arrowhead enjoying my break when I got the warning and was horrified. I find it crazy that I am witnessing the effects of climate change in areas that are so valuable to me. I can not imagine the University I am attending being destroyed by a tornado or my childhood home burning from a fire. My life would be so chaotic. Another thing that this article have educated me on was how Farmers are now going from growing water dependent crops, like avocados, to tropical crops such as limes, dragon fruit, passion fruit, and coffee.  It is crazy how farmers are having to adopt and adjust their ways of producing in order to survive and make a living. 
 <br><br>

I agree with the article that Santa Barbara does lack action.  Individuals are selfish and unwilling to give up certain things out of habit or simply pleasure. It is hard to convince someone to change their ways, such as, eating meat, consuming less from the fashion industry, using less water, quicker showers, etc. One action that has been taken at UCSB was getting rid of Isla Vista annual Floatopia. This event is where thousands of our college student party right along the beach under Del Playa. At the end of the event, the beach was full of trash, beer boxes, and food which does not help the contamination of the ocean. But, I believe that people in general will always find another way to destroying the planet. For instance, If they take away partying on the beach, it will only lead to trashing the streets.

Growing up in Southern California I am no stranger to our fire season, and when I was researching UCSB I was familiar with its history of fires and subsequent mudslides. It seems in the age of the climate crisis it has become common to experience these “natural” disasters year-round and have our brave firemen working hard battling deadly fires while they say this is the normal job when in all reality the degree of these disasters is not normal. As mentioned in the article as well as repeated by Hiltner in the video, a quarter of California’s 40 million population lives in the danger areas of wildfires. This is a shock to me that at a moment notice residences have to pack up there stuff and be displaced because of a natural disaster that has been made more dangerous due to climate change. Something that has also left me confused is some people still choose to believe climate change is real but as California residents, we are currently living through one of the consequences that come along with the climate crisis. Another point that they bring up in the article is that there has been a hike in sales of electrical generators, but what they barely mention is those residents who cannot afford a generator or any protection for there properties in the event of a fire. Many residents are under-prepared for disaster and no one is informing that they have to prepare for the worse, the “best” that is being done is PG&E are shutting off their power during risk times, but that does nothing for the lower class who are living in the danger zones. What will happen to them when their stuff burns down in a fire? Calfornia will have its own problem with its own climate migrants.

2 C : Beyond the Limit  was an interesting read as it mentioned the issues Santa Barbara County has been facing, a place that has become home to most of us here at the university. The article began with Bowman’s experience and as she explained that since 2016 they’ve been preparing for what “once had been unthinkable” demonstrates that such events make us aware of the actions we should take to survive future disastrous events. She states, that when another event happened in the canyon, “we just kind of shifted into action, we were so used to it”. This made me realize that something that they've grown accustomed to these “annual event[s]” and this is quite a worrisome problem. 
 <br><br>


The unpredictable weather has had an effect on the region and as we know,  this is brought about by climate change. We are all aware of the risks of wildfires, mudslides, and droughts, but we can agree that we haven’t done much preparation. Many, in the article, mentioned the worry about many residents not being prepared for these types of disastrous climate change events. 
 <br><br>


The warming rate pace is accelerating and it is alarming to know that Santa Barbara County has risen 2.3 C. As they mentioned the Thomas Fire, I recall at that time wondering how I'd be able to leave santa barbara and not realizing how many people were being affected by this event. 
 <br><br>
Homes and lives were lost and reading about this now, makes me realize how close we’ve come to witness these catastrophic events. I do believe that there is a lack of preparedness because no one is aware or would have expected such an event. Many since then have taken action and have mentioned that they are coming together in their communities to plan and discuss future evacuation plans. 
 <br><br>


Mentioned in a small section of the article that cars are the biggest contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions affecting the counties, brought me back to discussing the issue with a few employees on campus. It surprised me that many who come up from Ventura County carpool. When I questioned why they responded, “ well it’s a small step taken by us to minimize pollution in the air”. Their response made me happy and realize that many around us are aware although it might be only a few who have decided to take action. 

 <br><br>

I had never taken an interest in finding out the reason behind why we have tar on our beaches. Reading that it dates back to the gigantic oil spill in 1969 in Santa Barbara beaches was quite surprising and I was rather fascinated that the tar from the still-seeping oil on our feet was from an incident that happened years ago.

“ 2°C: Beyond the limit” wake me up about the situation at UCSB. When I first arrived here, I thought the environmental condition here is fantastic. However, this article reminds me that here is under the influence of climate crisis. The disasters like the wildfires have become an annual event in California, which is terrifying. Such disasters are prohibitable and shouldn’t be a regular event, so we should contribute our effort to save the environment in California. The two degrees are not only just the temperature limitation but also the reminder about climate problem. The environment has already become so serious that even a small fluctuation can cause serious results. The increment in temperature represents more disasters like the “Fire in Paradise”, and thousands of local people will suffer for our negative influence in the environment. Therefore, when I heard that someplace has already surpassed the two degrees limitation, I can foresee more disasters in the future if we don’t take any extra action to fix it. The good news is that there are some actions been taken, as the Climate Action Plan. With the effort of officials and individuals, I believe we can press the temperature down and make the climate better.

Growing up, I had an unwittingly parochial view of the environment outside of my direct view. Although I grew up just 2-3 hours away from here, my inclination to conserve the environment did not arrive until I got to UCSB and began taking this class. An example of my own personal ignorance to the immense effects of climate change is the fact that I did not even know there was a tornado in Ventura until I heard it from this class. I've always believed that tornado risk was confined to states like Oklahoma and Kansas. I am frankly terrified by the notion of tornados anywhere near me and I had no idea that climate change could expose different areas to entirely different types of environmental catastrophe. Moving to Santa Barbara has made things so much more tangible for me. I was blown away by the part of the article that mentioned that by 2060, 78% of Isla Vista's beachside cliffs may be lost to erosion. I was also shocked to read that the city of Santa Barbara, while ostensibly focused on the environment, still makes decisions that perpetuate the high rate of emissions. I was particularly disappointed to read that although the city pledged to decrease emissions from 2007-2015, emissions have increased 14%. To me, this is almost worse because it convinces everyday people that those in power are doing what they can to stop climate change, but in reality, that is not the case. I think people feel excused from personal environmentalism because the government is taking care of it and they think their decisions do not matter. This article adds to my own personal sense of responsibility. Learning that Ventura is one of the fastest heating places in the United States was perplexing to me because I always assumed California, being typically mild/Mediterranean, was near impervious to the immediate effects of the climate crisis. I had also barely considered the effect of this change on Californian agriculture which provides crops for most of the country. Considering this, as well as the effect of cattle on the environment, has made me realize that farms are both a huge part of the problem but also potential victims to the issue they create. Articles like this should be much more widespread in this area because people will finally step up and make changes when they realize their personal home and possessions are at stake. Once again, I am left shaken by the reading but I understand the necessity of things like this. Fear is essential to evoking activism within people.

I believe that having the article, “2ºC: Beyond the Limit", assigned to us as the article for the week was a very eye opening experience not only for myself, but all of us students taking the course. This article covers the climate change issue in the areas of Ventura, Montecito, and most importantly our own community, Santa Barbara. To have read the article and understand that fires and mudslides are not a norm in the area, but only began recurring annually since 2016 is a very concerning fact. Climate change is very much a pressing and dangerous issue that is often times ignored and deemed as unimportant by many across the country. For those who are in denial in the state of California alone, I believe that this article will help in addressing the issue, understanding what it is, and how it is growing at an exponentially rapid pace in the past couple of years. Anyone who lives in California and especially those who live in Ventura and Santa Barbara county need to read this article to become educated on how our community is in danger and the detrimental effects climate change is currently causing and will continue to cause to our home in the very near future. 

 <br><br>

A piece of the article that caught my eye and stuck with me was a comment that was made by the Santa Barbara county supervisor on the issue of climate change in the area. The supervisor stated, "Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world - something important but remote."  This comment represents the mentality that many people not only in California, but the entire United States have on the issue of climate change and the effects it can have on our world. If something is not personally affecting a group of people, they will pay little to no mind to it because it is not ruining their lives. So many disastrous things happen to people in lesser developed countries on a daily basis that highly impacts their chance of survival. These problems are then never talked about, and if they are, only for a short moment and then are quickly dismissed and forgotten. People will not begin to take action or even show concern about the issue of climate change until it personally affects them and their community.

This comment really stood out to me. The topics conveyed were the exact ones that I had in mind while reading this article. The fact that everywhere will soon see, if not are already seeing the effects of climate change is insane. Furthermore, the place that I go to college is the fastest heating place in the US is quite disheartening. This planet is going to be consumed by anthropogenic climate change really quickly if we do not act. As a person who lives in Texas and goes to school in California, I can tell you that California is a very special and beautiful place, but if we don’t treat it and the world like it is special, we will eventually lose both. The second half of this comment was the part that really hit me though. When they talked about how people are always talking about how bad climate change is and how we need to fix it, yet never actually act on it is very true. This is a very global, yet especially American thing. We talk and/or tweet about how we need to make changes, yet wait for others to do the work for us. I thought that Santa Barbara would be different though since it did have an enormous effect on the start of the environmental movement, but when the article said that it was just like the rest of America, I was very upset. I went to this school and this place and even California because I knew it was environmentally friendly and wanted to make a change, but now I feel as if only a few people are the ones wanting to make the change. I also enjoyed this comment because it talked about how people only care about things relevant to them, and as we can see the climate crisis should be relevant to everyone, yet some people just aren’t seeing the effects yet. This article was a good read for Californians especially us students because it really put the climate crisis in perspective and showed us it will affect us if not sooner rather than later.

I grew up in California and love it so much, like many other Californians. “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" gave me a new perspective on the climate crisis as it addressed how it has affected California, a place that is very near and dear to me. Many times we hear about the climate crisis affecting other states or countries but because we aren't able to see the actual damage, it doesn't have that shock factor that pushes people to act. However, Californians are very aware of the fires that have plagued California, destroying homes and habitats and filling the air with ash and smoke. 

 <br><br>

I learned that in Santa Barbara, the erosion of the rock cliffs is affecting housing by the beach, now needing the support of concrete beams to be safe to inhabit. I had no idea about this and it was shocking to hear because I go to school here yet I haven’t heard any mention of it. Santa Barbara is regarded as a very environmentally conscious city yet it has not been meeting its goals, this was a surprise to me initially. But as I continued to read the article, it became very clear to me why. The same way that I personally know how the environment is being hurt by some of my daily actions, such as meat consumption and plastic use, the city of Santa Barbara is struggling to act on what they are fighting for. To be conscious of the climate crisis is great, but what is needed is action on those concerns. I think part of what's happening is people tend to rationalize small injustices to the environment, that "it isn't so bad" or "they won't do it next time". But the accumulation of these small actions, like littering every now and then, overtime build up, especially as an entire city's population shares the notion. And because we consider them small, we generally forget about it and still think of ourselves as environmentally conscious people. It is terribly difficult to reverse these small daily habits that we practice in our daily lives, but maybe if we try to be more considerate, put more effort, and educate ourselves, change can happen.

After reading "2° C: Beyond the Limit, it was almost unbelievable the amount of warming that has happened in Santa Barbara and Ventura. Coming here as a first-year, it's climate and scenery is almost like paradise, especially compared to the hot and smoggy valley, the cool breeze can be felt almost anytime, and the temperature stays in a pretty consistent range. To hear that my new home is one of the areas that has been most affected by global warming in the US is such a bitter truth and makes me scared to see what's in store for the next few years I will live here. The idea that DP could no longer exist by 2060 is insane, such a socially relevant and significant street would be a terrible loss, especially considering how desperate the housing situation is for students. 

 <br><br>

When I first got to campus I was amazed by the number of compostable items available, the emphasis on recycling and placing the right items into the right place to be disposed of, just the atmosphere of conservation was admirable. Growing up in the Central Valley, there really was no effort into putting out compostable disposable cups or other materials from local and large companies. The idea that there were compostable plastic cups was completely alien to me, but I love the effort. And in seeing different ground like CALPIRG on-campus that campaigns towards renewable energy and banning fracking, I had the impression UCSB and Santa Barbara was a very progressive place in climate activism and conservation. So to read that essentially Santa Barbara is like any other city in being held back by business and corporate interests from making actual progress in attacking the climate crisis is disheartening. From the place where it has such a rich history in the climate movement, I would expect so much more effort in being a forerunner in the state and country in cutting back emissions and actually making a difference. Isn't being one of the most affected areas in the US by climate change initiative enough??

Last year, when I first arrived at Santa Barbara, I was amazed by its wonderful ocean views and anticipated to see these landscape every day. However, my mood was disrupted when I saw those offshore drilling platforms. They’re like some stain on a beautiful picture. After reading the article, I begin to worry about the future of Santa Barbara and California. I am surprised by the picture that shows Santa Barbara has risen almost 2.5 degree in the past 100 years. Even big cities like San Francisco has only rise 1.5 degree. Before I am not aware of how these few increase in temperature can cause severe damage to the environment. When the passage tells me the severity of the Thomas Fire, I feel sad about the future of California. As the temperature rises at an accelerating speed and more lands are threaten by fire, people are still living in the same way and are not willing to change. More traffic and more cars are in the road and more oil drilling platforms are built. When I hear that the big fossil fuel companies blocked the decision to stop fracking and drilling, I wonder could our world have a future when it is controlled by these greedy people.

“2°C: Beyond the limit” is a well written article that really serves its purpose. Unlike Wallace and his article “Uninhabitable Earth”, Wilson manages to create a sense of urgency through his writing without having to throw dismal and very depressing potential outcomes in our faces. Although the article itself is nowhere near optimistic, it still provides information that the general public is in desperate need of hearing.
 <br><br>

Upon initially hearing that UCSB has launched an initiative to be the first carbon neutral institution by 2025, I was full of pride and excitement to be a part of a community that will set an example for the world to follow. After reading Wilson’s article, however, I am worried that we have been given false hope through the use of empty promises. The county of Santa Barbara is well known for its efforts to fight climate change, but the horrifying reality behind this facade is that very little action has actually been taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that they previously promised to do in 2015. What is even more shocking is that two years after pledging to reduce greenhouse emissions, Santa Barbara has instead exceeded emission levels by 14 percent. The fact that we have yet to effectively fight the climate crisis while already having exceeded the temperature threshold has me dumbfounded. How can we just sit on our butts and watch the world rot in front of us? 
 <br><br>

In addition to this, I find it unbelievable that farmers are having to rely on crops that were once unable to grow here due to our changing climate. When one thinks of pitaya and agave they would usually envision a drastically different and hotter environment, but sadly that’s what California is becoming and we will eventually have to say our farewells to the beloved avocado. 
 <br><br>

While this article has been eye opening, I can’t help but to feel largely pessimistic of our future. It seems as if we are all talk but no action. It is time that we actually hold on to our goals instead of brushing them off until it is too late. I’m tired of having to wash tar off of my feet after walking on the beach. We should be able to enjoy our fresh air without having to worry about any health risk

I agree with you in the sense that the county of Santa Barbara needs to start turning their words into action. For example, in the article, it said that in recent years, there has only been one person who has been directly responsible for moving towards renewable energy. For a city that prides itself in being environmentally conscientious, there needs to be a better effort in enacting policies and regulations that practices what it preaches. Like you, I also can’t help but to be pessimistic. It seems that no matter how severe climate change may prove to be, there will still be a blind eye turned towards the problem. What I found especially hypocritical and contradicting was learning about how county officials were actively considering a proposal for a drilling expansion in the north while they claim that they have climate goals for the future. This interest in the fossil fuel economy is something I feel is what is preventing true reform in environmental politics. With this article hitting close to home, we can see how UCSB itself will be affected in the future. But not only that, we can see how the rest of California will be affected too. With agriculture, wildfires, and increasing climate posing a serious danger to Californians, we have no choice but to be self-conscious about our habits and how our environment is affected by them. I really do hope that we aren’t just all talk and that UCSB can really commit to moving towards being carbon neutral!

I really appreciated how this article was structured. I felt like it was very interactive and displayed infographics in a well construed manner. I think it was a message in itself that you could choose a county in comparing the annual temperature change from 1895-2018 because though one may not be a resident, there is some familiarity with at least one (ex. we are all in the same county to attend UCSB) and to see a place of recognition be so impacted makes this concept of climate change more tangible. This happened to me with the conversation of the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean along Santa Barbara’s Del Playa Drive. It’s a popular area for UCSB students and a favorite spot for many. One apartment described has an incredible view, but it’s unfortunately so eroded that it’s braced by netting and perhaps won’t make it in twenty years time. It’s terrifying how things so beautiful are so easily destroyed and this can be catalyzed by more neglect over the climate crisis.
 <br><br>

A perk to Santa Barbara is its great sunny weather, but I would take rain as a sacrifice to overturn the climate crisis. Santa Barbara has risen by over 2.3 C and one of the effects that Professor Hiltner mentioned is something I’ve noticed and experienced: the wishy washy weather. It’s super warm during the day and alarmingly quickly does it become colder. There’s been scarier consequences, referencing back to David Wallace-Wells and his article “The Uninhabitable Earth.” What more will we have to face? Will we reach the end where we won’t be able to combat anymore?

<p>
I found this reading very interesting because it was based here in California. This is all of our homes that are being affected. The part within the reading that points out how some houses on Del Playa won’t be there in 20 years was crazy to think about. Students within this class live in those houses along the cliff. Eventually, they won’t be able to show their kids where they spent their college years. I also find it ironic how Santa Barbara is supposed to be the leading city for climate change activists but still manages to exceed limits that are wanted for the county. Everyone views Santa Barbara as the heart of climate change action, which rightly earned its name but now is lacking in that area. The climate is changing so rapidly that as people in political power, it is difficult to keep up with. There were no plans created in time for the rapid change that will continue to become faster. Laws needed to be put into place years ago to help prevent and lessen the prevalence of fires, oil spills, and cliff erosions. The idea of a tornado in California blows my mind and is extremely weird to hear about when I come from the middle of the US where tornados are normalized. This is not natural and shows us that the climate is in much more danger than we think it is. As stated in another comment, the “moral laziness” among Americans and Santa Barbara citizens will cause them to continue to suffer. Maybe the lack of avocados will motivate them.

After reading this article, I felt a great amount of concern. I mainly felt this way after seeing how badly our home state is getting affected by climate change. It honestly saddens me and brings fear that the places I call home are being gravely affected. The Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties have both  warmed 2.3 degrees Celsius since 1895; both places I call home. It is concerning to see how quickly these changes are happening. What’s also concerning is how we have actually experienced firsthand events of climate change in recent memory, with devastating fires affecting various of our counties. It’s not just fires affecting us as just a couple weeks ago while on break, a tornado alert was sent, which is very uncommon in our state. Our counties are heating up at a very rapid rate that at this point I don’t know if it can be controlled. It causes fear to think about possible incidents that can continue to occur and affect the places I love and care about. It affects all of us and I honestly can’t imagine a planet where we can’t reside in due to temperatures we can’t tolerate. I think there are solutions out there for this and we can’t let this get more out of control anymore.

Before coming to SB I heard that it is the birthplace of Earth Day. I was excited to be attending a school that cared about the land we live and work on. Sadly, after reading “2ºC: Beyond the Limit"  I have found out that SB is not living up to its green reputation. In fact, the article says that SB strived to reduce emissions by 15% but instead did the exact opposite and increased emissions by 14% since 2007. The lack of enforcement is going to be what kills us in the end. I can acknowledge how it is definitely an issue that is taken seriously and given much thought amongst government officials and even us, as students, however the execution is lacking. This lack of execution on behalf of civilians and those in positions of power are due to two main reasons: convenience and marginal utility. For the average American, when having to choose between driving and walking most would realistically choose driving. Why? Because it is the most convenient. Also, people do not seem to instantly reap any benefits from choosing the more environmentally friendly mode of transportation. When deciding whether or not to eat steak, the average carnivore would rather eat the meat as they think that they gain more utility from eating the meat than they do with saving the planet. The benefits that one receives from helping the climate crisis are not so visible now, which is the main reason why this problem is so difficult to face. Most people want immediate results to prove that they are doing something that actually helps the problem. This cape of invisibility is what is fooling people to not contribute to the climate crisis. I am guilty of also wanting instant benefits or instant satisfaction that I am actually making a contribution to saving the planet. However, we all need to trust in the process, contribute now, and reap the benefits of a restored Earth later.

"If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?" (Wilson, Scott, *Fires, floods and free parking: California’s unending fight against climate change*, Washington Post, 2019). 
 <br><br>

No one will. At least, no large and influential enough group will act until it is too late. Pessimistic? Yes, perhaps. Humanity is excellent at "short term" preservation. We have created a complex inter-connected world where the private interests of many rely on other private interests in an immutable amalgamation of needs. It is not the consequence of some arcane magic that we can live today in a tremendous array of comfort. It is no act of God that a vast majority of Americans can buy mobile telephones without going massively in to debt. We have created a globalized world where cheap labour feeds the desires of developed and developing societies. This system of interconnection -- an obligatory system if we wish to maintain our modern comforts -- obviously has dramatic consequences for the environment. Are we willing to sacrifice these comforts? Perhaps a few of us, but not the masses. We are so obsessed with individual rights, so consumed by the need for more, so enthralled by utilitarianism and individualism, that we remain shell shocked in the face of ultimate calamity.

Reading the article really opened my eyes as I had always heard that Santa Barbara was always so environmentally active. Learning that the county has only increased greenhouse gas emissions rather than reducing them as it was originally planned was shocking to me. The issue with the Paris Climate Accords is that although many countries agree to certain goals in meeting levels of emissions, there is no enforcement of these regulations to actually meet the goal. The article made me realize that this applies to all things. Santa Barbara is no exception. It has been affected so much by climate change and it is no surprise to me now that it is because the county itself did not enforce these regulations. 
  <br><br>
With a rapidly changing climate, more of the population is being displaced and more catastrophic events are bound to happen. Looking at the facts, Santa Barbara being one of the many places being affected so much already should not come as a surprise, yet it did. Increase of forest fires, mudslides, droughts, and even tornadoes? This hypocrisy in the county needs to come to an end if we expect to see any real change. Environmental activism began here, it should not end here either.

After reading last week's article, The Uninhabitable Earth, I felt bombarded with reason after reason why to take climate change carefully. Going into this week’s article, 2 Degrees C: Beyond the Limit, I been known how serious this topic is. It did surprise me, however, that even Santa Barbarians seem to be doing what the rest of the country is: being, as SB’s county supervisor put it, “environmental poseurs.” I think that much of the time people do mean when they say that they want to support climate action, but do not want to be hassled to go out of their way to do it. It is especially bothersome that Santa Barbarans are like this because this is one of the most environmentally conscious places in the country! I think that people will be totally on board after a catastrophe, like the oil spill in 1969, but then once those emotions fade, are hesitant to follow through with promises. This is why I think it is especially prudent when the article brings up changes that directly influence people's lives locally. Hopefully the local points of the article will make people understand how real and close all of this is. It is not far away and it is not going away: it is here and it is now. If that doesn’t make people change then I’m not sure what will. Maybe we will have to wait until another huge catastrophe happens and use that energy to finally make radical change. ALSO I got so angry at the people in the article who were fighting the parking issue because it hurts business. Yes, that makes sense, BUT it will hurt business even more if climate weirdness knocks down the whole building that the business is in!! Stay woke yall

This article, “2 degrees C: Beyond The Limit”  seemed to impact me stronger than I was expecting. This is principally because the article is centered around Santa Barbara, a place I now call home. Although rise in temperature, intensifying fires, and a crumbling cliff side are consequences of the climate crisis in the Santa Barbara area, I was previously unaware of the science behind why these occur. From the article I learned that the thinning layer of marine fog, which decreases the moisture in the air, in addition to the rise in air temperature is what has made the socal area increasingly susceptible to wildfires in the past few years. I was also sad to learn that by 2060 there is a chance students won't get to experience living on the cliffs of DP, because rising sea levels will collapse those structures. 
  <br><br>

The quote: “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something,” is very accurate in describing not only the state of Santa Barbara, but the U.S. A lot of people know action needs to be taken to solve the climate crisis, yet are very hesitant to make lifestyle changes unless its convenient to them. This is why the climate crisis is so hard to solve. The vast majority of people and companies in the U.S. are wasteful and environmentally harmful. Businesses and families would have to reconstruct the way they are run in order to really make a difference. Although this may seem like a lot to ask, it is crucial in order for a positive impact to be made.

Santa Barbara is a city that talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk. The Post's climate analysis reveals the harsh truth about the cradle of the Earth Day movement: it has immense amounts of vehicles, the beach is full of tar, and the ocean horizon is dotted with oil rigs. But there are always solutions to these sorts of problems, mostly stemming from culture and lifestyle. I wanted to focus on this particular line from the article that stuck out to me. 
  <br><br>


"If there is a God-given civic right in which Santa Barbarans believe, it is bountiful and convenient free public parking."

  <br><br>

Car culture has infected the American public consciousness. Americans would gladly throw away their beef and hand over their guns in exchange for keeping their cars. Perhaps for some, there is good reason for this. But when everyone indulges in this modern convenience, even when most trips are within a few miles of the home, then there is a huge problem. As Ken has said in lecture, one car alone will release far more than a person's allotted 'carbon budget' of 2 metric tons each year (to keep climate change under control). Some, especially business owners, will claim that reduced parking downtown means less people coming in, but this is not necessarily the case. For example, replacing road-side parking space with bike infrastructure would incentivize that mode of transport more (protected bike lanes are far superior to the "sharrows" used almost universally in Santa Barbara). Also, the wealthy who indulge in the downtown shops in the first place can easily afford an e-bike, which makes cycling through the perfect mediterranean climate and relatively flat terrain even easier. California may soon pass a bill that would fund up to $1000 of any e-bike purchase, further incentivizing this mode of transport. Any trip within 10 miles of the home could easily be done with an e-bike in nearly the same time, if not faster in some cases. 

  <br><br>

Even then, one could say that cars increase productivity by getting us places faster, but this simple statement that we've accepted as the status quo needs to be examined. By contributing immensely to the climate crisis, especially in counties like Santa Barbara, cars could decrease productivity in the long run, and far more than anyone may expect. For instance, as mentioned in the article, agriculture suffers from generally heightened temperatures, dryness, and "global weirding", when the temperature sharply goes up during the day, then plummets at night. The result is scorched, parched crops (especially the avocado around here) and thousands of dead livestock. On the psychological level, cars decrease productivity twofold. First is the anecdotal (but also well documented) effect that getting into a car has on a person's mood, namely increased rage and decreased empathy. Second is the decreased productivity resulting directly from increased global temperatures: hotter climates naturally make people more irritable. Therefore, the people of Santa Barbara should seriously consider the consequences of their transportation choices, namely their cars fueled by oil mere miles away that pollutes their pristine beaches and clean air.

This Washington Post article has impressively informed me about many environmental changes caused by the change of climate, and many of them was unknown to me before reading this, so I think it’s quite an educative article to read. I was only familiar with sea level rises, drought, flood, and wild fire, but was not aware of the others, such as the erosion of cliffs and rocks, the shift of marine layer and thus the amount of smog and fog, and coastal moisture. The article suggests that the above changes are actually building up the risk and possibility of wild fires. The relativeness of talking about the climate change specifically in Santa Barbara makes me feel very connected and alarmed because I believe all of us have personally experienced and witnessed the wild fire last quarter. I could see the flame on the top of the mountain right outside my dorm window. 

  <br><br>

The stats in the article are telling us that we are neither preparing enough for the incidents nor are we making enough actions to prevent them from happening again, especially the emission in Santa Barbara has even gone beyond the standard limit set before hand. Not only this makes me upset but also thinking about the death and loss of wild animal lives, too. 
  <br><br>


The last part where the article talks about the regulations to improve emissions and emergency actions when there is a wild fire is kind of abrupt, to me, and ends the entire article oddly as well without a conclusion or a proposal of solution or any of sort. All I learnt from this last part is that the government is not doing enough and there are many ineffective or incomplete policies reacting to the rapid change of climate and the rise of fire danger. Many more rules need to be made and established and there seems to be a communication gap between the government and the people need to be filled in.

“2°C: Beyond the limit" is an eye-opening article. Compare to last week reading, I had a more thorough understanding of catastrophic consequences caused by climate change after reading this article. That is because Wilson’s article focused on describing disasters happened in Santa Barbara County, where is the place I lived right now. Hence, it will not make me think climate change as something important but remote. Examples used by Wilson, illustrating the terrible impacts of growing heat and loss of moistures, are events recently happened around us, which warned me of the urgency and severity of climate change. Meanwhile, when I read the part of wildfire, I thought back to what happened last Christmas, which is the first time I have been in close contact with a wildfire. Combined with the content of the article, I realized we need to take action quickly.



</p><hr>


<p>

Before Thanksgiving, there was another wildfire that right took place in front of my eyes. Because of the fire, school was cancelled, which resulted in two additional days of vacation. To be honest, I was quite excited to hear about the cancellation of school, while enjoying a stunning natural view of the fire that I’ve never seen in my life before. Well, after reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit”, I’m ashamed of the emotion I was having at that moment and more of the unawareness and complete lack of preparedness to the exasperate issue of climate change.
  <br><br>
Climate change has severely destructed the ecosystem that we’re relying on. While it causes more severe natural disasters more frequently, it also has tremendous impacts on things that we daily live on: change of crops, uncertainty of electricity, extinction of animals… To me, It’s hard to imagine that Santa Barbara, usually considered as a mild and predictable place, has shifted to a place, where intense fire and extreme weather take place and the fact has definitely helped make me correct one common belief that I used to have: climate change is something important but remote.
  <br><br>
Climate change has become a global issue that every single of us should be responsible for as it affects all human beings living on the earth. Urgency is not required anymore but instead mandatory for all of us. Instead of spending time deciding who to blame, let’s use that time to plant a tree.

“2 C: Beyond the Limit” was a very eye-opening reading for me. I was unaware that Santa Barbara has had such a drastic rise in its average temperature. Also, consequently, I did not realize that the whole entire state has also been seeing such drastic changes that have resulted in numerous wildfires that have destroyed homes and wildlife. It’s also scary to know that these fires have dangerous effects way after the fire has gone out. Such as the landslide in 2018 that killed 23 people. This whole area where I go to school is being drastically changed by the severe weather. I really hope we can take charge and prevent these drastic changes and preserve California and all its beautiful nature.

It is hard to see the direct affects of this 2 degree temperature increase unless there is a life threatening event that occurs. While it may not be obvious in everyday life, the sad reality is that Santa Barbara has faced multiple severe weather events and fires as a result of this rise. In my time here at UCSB I have witnessed 2 fires and the mudslides and even strange weather events such as tornado warnings which are all extremely unusual for this part of the country. It is really sad to see how negatively we are being affected by these events that did not usually happen before. It is not fair to be living in a constant state of fear that your home is going to get burned down or swept away.  Massive fires should not be normalized and action should be taken to combat the climate crisis and to prevent these life threatening patterns from continuing.

I absolutely loved the California-centric approach for this article. From the sea level rise, to the smog filled cities, to the vast farmlands, California acts as a great small scale model of the variety of crises climate change is bestowing upon the earth. “[A]ltering the choice of crops on some of the nation’s most bountiful farms, erasing the certainty of electrical power in some of its wealthiest homes and exposing the limits of environmental activism among some of its most liberal voters.” This excerpt outlines perfectly the diversity of harm that the climate crisis is causing. It’s very telling to me how wealth and social class quickly go out the window when it comes to survival, suddenly cities such as Santa Barbara have opened their eyes, only to find themselves face to face with the world’s sixth mass extinction. As Scott Wilson puts it, “you know it’s coming, but you are not preparing.” I find this dazed dismissal to be bewildering, remember growing up making earthquake kits and The Great Shakeout drills in elementary school? The issues of violently unpredictable weather and a warming climate have been overlooked for too long. At this rate, Santa Barbara is aiming to lose its marine layer, environmentally friendly reputation, agriculture backbone, and, eventually, their tourist appeal. Their continuous dismissal of combating climate change is largely the fault of greedy politicians, working behind the scenes. They favor the taxes that businesses bring in for them, and big oil money over the well being of the land. My question is that if a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, then who will?

After reading this article, I feel more connected to the issue of climate change. I used to think about this problem through the scale of countries and continents, but this article let me see clearly how climate changes in different county. It’s really heartbreaking to see the change in shorelines and how creatures are harmed by that. The warming ocean leads to a sudden decline in the number of oysters, urchins, and crabs, leading to the disarray of harvest. Thirteen whales was washed ashore dead as a result of the warming ocean as well, the mass decline of small ocean creatures reduces the amount of food available for the whales, so they have to migrate to other water area to hunt for food and eventually end up dying in the shallower water.

It’s astonishing to read that the fire season in Santa Barbara is year round now. The Thomas fire in 2018 was a hard strike in the height of the holiday season. Being devoured by the fire and soaked by the heavy rain, steep hillsides collapsed and caused casualties. I didn’t see the Thomas fire, but there was a fire last year right before the Thanksgiving holiday, and it was also followed by heavy rains that lasted for the whole Thanksgiving break. I totally agree with Das Williams that before actually seeing the rain and fire, they all sounded like crisis in other parts of the world to me - they sound important, but will never happen to me. This article raises my awareness regarding how close they actually are compared to my imagination, and I feel more urged to take action to stop it from worsening.

<p>
“2°C: Beyond the Limit” begins by telling the story of Terri Bowman, a manager at a camp resort in Santa Barbara who has rethought the safety measures being taken at the resort after facing an increase in natural disasters. Although it is reassuring to see that some people are taking precautions and preparing for the worst, it is sad to know that we have to do so with such increasing urgency. Fires and mudslides have always been an unfortunate threat that we need to be concerned about, but as we continue to worsen the state of the climate crisis these threats have become more frequent and more violent. We should not have to constantly worry that the next devastating wildfire could take claim of our homes or even our loved ones. It is incredibly frustrating to see that although the people of Santa Barbara have seen firsthand the effects of our negligence the seemingly “progressive” county has done little to actually take action. Even though this is the birthplace of the Earth Day movement that means nothing if we do not continue to be proactive and think of new and innovative ways to combat the climate crisis. We are too concerned about superficial things such as “[making] sure the city’s breezy, Mediterranean aesthetic remains intact” rather than actually putting policies in place that will change the course to disaster that we are currently on. 
  <br><br>


The article touches on several different topics that fall under the more general umbrella of how Santa Barbara is being affected by the climate crisis. One section that was particularly alarming was the discussion of how Isla Vista is being affected. Often we hear about extreme weather events in other states or countries and are able to selfishly and naively separate ourselves from the tragedy and consequences of our own actions. Not only have students been affected by nearby fires that send smoke our way but some are watching the cliffs underneath their homes crumble. It was hard to watch as students who were here during the Thomas Fire as they heard about the Cave Fire because they knew just how bad the situation could get in such a short amount of time. When classes were not cancelled until part of the school day had already passed people were walking to class with masks on in hope of  not breathing in the smoky air. While we felt only minor effects, people closer to the fire were forced to evacuate their homes not knowing what they would return to. 

  <br><br>

An aspect of Santa Barbara I was not aware of was just how much agriculture we have. This farmland and the crops it produces are being threatened but some farmers are quickly adapting to find solutions in our changing climate. Although this innovative thinking is encouraging it is overall very worrisome that the farms are being threatened by drought, extreme heat, and fires. Some farmers are starting to decrease their focus on avocados, which need large amounts of water, and refocusing their efforts towards agave plants. The farm’s effort to use less water is a concept that more businesses need to get on board with. Everyone should find their own way to work towards being more sustainable even if it is just starting with one small effort. If every business in Santa Barbara took just one action to try to help our planet it could make a significant difference that would progressively lead to more and more change. If we want to keep the reputation of being environmentally progressive we need to actually earn it back because for far too long we have ignored the responsibility of being good stewards of the earth.

I found it ironic that the Santa Barbara county allows actions such as the new oil drilling projects that further contribute to climate change despite it being the birthplace of modern environmental activism. The county also does not enforce regulations on carbon emissions by businesses and individuals regularly, and I think it all comes down to the opportunity cost of actually enforcing what the county said it would do. It seems strange to me that on one hand the county is acknowledging the seriousness of climate change, and on the other hand is not doing anything effective about it. I think this ties back to the situations of the corporates from the film “Before the Flood”, the private businesses knew the reality of climate change but choose to mislead the public to protect their profits. Maybe the SB county cares more about economic growth than the effects of climate change, but it’s certainly no good in the long run. Overall, I think the article was really informative as it provided me insights on how climate change could impact the local community in ways that I would never have thought about, and how parts of Southern California could lose its beautiful climate in the future if inaction continues.

Scott Wilson talks about a very important notion in his article that most people know that climate change is happening on a global scale, but fail to understand that it is also occurring in our own backyards. This idea is exemplified perfectly by Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams when he explains that people think about climate change like they think of refugee crisis in other parts of the world--how it is something that is important and crucial to act on, but too remote to have to do so immediately. I myself have been guilty of this mindset up until my freshman year of college when the Thomas Fire occurred. Santa Barbara was supposed to be a region of perfect, mild year-round weather. From that fire on, it has been anything but. The Santa Barbara County isn't the only region to see extreme climate crisis, but also the Bay Area. Wealthier neighborhoods that never experience any problems are having power outages caused by wildfires erupting left and right seemingly out of the blue. Now that people are experiencing the dangers and consequences of climate change first-hand, hopefully there is greater incentive to start taking action to combat the global climate crisis in even the smallest of ways.

I was surprised to learn that Ventura County is the fastest heating county in the country. So was everyone I told about it. It is disappointing that Santa Barbara has strayed from their original leadership in the environmental movement. If a place as liberal as Santa Barbara can't look beyond profit and convenience to support political change, it is hard to imagine other places doing it. I found something hopeful in this article from the bit about neighbors meeting regularly to discuss the climate after experiencing wildfires. Much of our lack of willingness to change our habits in favor of more sustainable ones can be traced to a general disconnect. For example, we are generally disconnected from our food. Most of the time, we don't know where it comes from, who harvested it, or how it eventually made it to our grocery stores. This general disconnect supports damaging food practices like factory farming. Our expectation of all kinds of produce all the time is ridiculous but most of us don't even think about it. The climate crisis will force us to confront our damaging habits. I hope that climate change will push us to reconnect with our food, with our planet, and with each other. When government fails, I believe people will get together and talk and try to figure things out on small scales, and I think that's amazing.

After reading this article comprehensively, I was reminded of the gravity of the situation and how climate change affects all of us, right now. Of course, everyone knows this, but we are well past the phase of education/building awareness on this issue and now need to take action; the issue with this, however, is that no one knows where to start, so a collective, depressing apathy can form. I personally grew up in California and have lived here my entire life, so hearing about a set of wildfires in the state is a disappointment but not a surprise. I was reminded of my own experiences when camp manager Terri Bowman mentioned that preparing for wildfires in her camp was now routine and inevitable. Obviously, people still care, but this is now becoming the norm in our lives and we need to do what we can to reverse that. 

<br><br>
It is also disheartening to see how behind Santa Barbara County and Ventura County are doing with their emissions. Since U.C Santa Barbara was one of the birthplaces of the environmental movement, one would think that they would be adamant about reducing their emissions. To read that Santa Barbara County has raised its CO2 emissions by 14% in the past 13 years is honestly so frustrating. Out of all of the counties in California, I would’ve believed that Santa Barbara would have taken more initiative in a problem that is only becoming worse.

I agree with you completely, I feel like every video reading or lecture we have had to comment about has impacted me in a way, but this one hits home a little different. Climate change is not simply a convention we read about, statistics we compute or stories we hear about far, far away. It is now happening in our own backyard. Thinking about how DP could possibly not exist in the next 40 years or so is not only distressing, it's also heartbreaking. Years and years of tradition quite literally could be washed away.
<br><br>
Like you, I also think that the time of educating the mass about the climate crisis is over, and a new dawn of action is upon us. However, I am also a strong believer that knowledge is power, and if we can ensure that the youth is informed, educated and ready to act, then we can ensure that history will not repeat itself with the older generation. One way UCSB could possibly do this is by making a class about climate change (like English 23) a mandatory class for all students. Just like we are obligated to take a class about American history, I think it is just as, if not more important, to take a class about climate change. I say this because prior to taking this class I was moderately informed about the climate crisis, but I was not alarmed and rather nonchalant about the whole thing. But now, merely two weeks into the quarter, I already feel a sense of urgency to act and to better myself for the greater good.

Reading this article really made clear that the effects of global warming are already clearly visible in our own homes and areas of residence, something that should be sobering and clear for all of us. I had no clue before lecture and prior to reading this article that Santa Barbara has already warmed by 2.3 degrees celcius and that the cliffs of DP were eroding away with every passing year. I cannot imagine an Isla Vista without the houses near the cliffs which act as a staple of the city bridging the past and the present through tradition, something that could possibly not exist in the future for later students if this trend of change continues at the rate its at. Additionally, it was shocking to hear from this article as well as in lecture that Ventura County was at the top of the highest warming counties in California, a place I have travelled across several times during roadtrips which I always thought was a calm and beautiful place to live. From the exterior you would never think that such beautiful places could one day cease to exist but the harsh reality is that our actions as human beings have directly placed the places and things we love in harms way for destruction, and there's no one to blame but ourselves. 
<br><br>

I find it sad that people such as myself I have to admit and others only see global warming as a valid threat to life as we know it when it directly affects them in their daily lives, when the reality is that things like this have been occuring all over the world with more drastically visible results. It's only now that Americans are able to see their lifestyles at stake that we acknowledge that this is a legitimate problem that needs to be dealt with when in reality we should all be taking steps to assuage the effects of global warming going on worldwide.

It is quite interesting to see how our community of many environmentalists and typically green progressive legislation handles these climate issues. I've found it interesting and a bit hypocritical that it is community that so avidly supports environmental movements around the globe and considers itself a hub for environmental change, yet it is a community that is also home to the high carbon footprints of many of our nations wealthiest people.
 <br><br>

As an area that is often a visiting place for people from far away areas looking for luxury, you'd think that the city would have more to say about the environmental impacts of its tourism and lifestyles. Not to say that the people of Santa Barbara are not thinking about these issues and trying to make a difference. There just seems to be many hypocrisies that are too difficult to ignore. Now that negative consequences of a changing climate are hitting close to home, it will be interesting to see the way the community reacts.  I know there are big pushes for community scale micro grids and other climate change mitigation tactics, but it seems that these are more responsive to disaster rather than proactive.

I was not very surprised to hear that Santa Barbara County was considered an “environmental poseur,” as I have been personally trying to learn more about how the county’s systems for addressing sustainability issues. Santa Barbara County’s lack of compost bins was one of the first things I noticed, coming from San Francisco (my hometown). I reflect back to how I was intrigued by UCSB because of its rating as the #2 Green School… It really does not seem that impressive. I can imagine how UCSB would be a bubble, given its concentration of liberal-leaning students and activists. This would then indicate that the rest of the county would not be as advanced in this area. I find that quite disappointing. 
 <br><br>


Further comparing Santa Barbara and San Francisco, I agree with the environmentalists pushing for replacing parking lots with housing. San Francisco is crammed with housing, and is quite known (especially around downtown) for having limited parking (to say the least). With that, public transportation is much more prevalent in most cities in California (and even around the bay area). As long as public transportation is funded and advanced enough, I think making the switch would be successful.

I completely agree with your sentiments and was very confused about how Santa Barbara wasn't as green as it claims to be. One of the reasons I picked UCSB was because of its green rating. I do think that Isla Vista is much more environmentally friendly than the rest of the county. I mean, students consume less and use bikes and busses more just for financial reasons alone, but we also do tend to care more, being younger and more liberal. I am so grateful for public transportation in Santa Barbara. I would feel dirty using cars or even the electric scooters around campus. But it does still need more work. Make sure to vote for pro-public transportation issues in local elections! It's the least we can do.
 <br><br>


The idea of parking lots being a big issue is so odd because that feels transparently evil. Every kid's movie is about a beloved park being torn down for a parking lot. They really did pave paradise and put up a parking lot, didn't they?


 <br><br>

I've been affected by the power outages that are fire prevention, I've had to evacuate because of a forest fire. I know these negative effects personally and I know many more have felt them much worse. Honestly, the statistic that 1/4 of our residents are in high-risk fire zones feels low. I've been wary of forest fires my whole life. I've seen Smokey the Bear as often as Tony the Tiger. For a state on the water, it is our downfall. 
 <br><br>


The numbers and issues listed in this article scare me, and I think they should. I would love it if we could get this information out to all the older wealthy people in Santa Barbara. We even are home to celebrities. If we got Opera on our side do you know how much more we could do? So campaign if you have the chance, and make some noise!

Seeing the home I lived in for a year in an article about falling cliffs, erosion, and climate change is very surreal and contributes to the passion I feel towards addressing the climate crisis. It is hard to deny that the climate crisis that is currently happening will not affect everyone, no longer making it an acceptable excuse to not take action or care about this issue. This article highlights that rising sea levels and more intense weather events are largely going to affect coastal communities, which the world has millions of. Regardless of having perfect scientific calculations, we know the climate is warming and we can see the negative impacts that have followed. We have seen how farmers and growers are often faced with the dilemma of what to attempt to grow due to warmer temperatures and less water available, such as transitioning from avocados to agave to remain profitable. As of now, people are still able to make changes to adapt to some challenges that have arisen from changing climates, but not everyone is as lucky, and I can imagine it will continue to be increasingly difficult to adapt to environmental changes. I think Wilson was right to investigate the changes in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties because the media and public eye are aware of the drastic weather events that have occurred here, like fires, mudslides, blackouts, and potential tornadoes. What I would like to see is more acknowledgement from our federal government about the disasters that have taken place here, and instead of only reacting in response, there needs to be preventative measures in place and officials have to seriously address this danger that affects every American (and every person worldwide).

As a California native, I'm terrified for every place I have ever known as home. I was born in Stanislaus county in Central California, which is now experiencing global weirding phenomena that endanger the local farms. I lived in Napa growing up, where the county's wine industry's economic impact on the U.S. is $34 billion. The vineyards keep my hometown alive, but in the past few years, I've seen more flooding than before, as well as raging wildfires that resulted in three weeks of missed school in my senior year of high school, as well as my family evacuating my childhood home. Many of my close friend's houses were destroyed by the fire, alone with a number of significant personal artifacts. If that's not terrible enough, I remember many of my classmates distraught because their parents, who are migrant workers and support the local industry, couldn't afford to take work off, so they had to work in the heat and smog.
 <br><br>
My summer camp, in the Sierra Nevada mountains, my safe haven, was ravaged by the Donnell Fire in August of 2018, right before sessions wrapped up. Thankfully, it stands, but our incredible landscape is still charred and changed forever. And now, I am here at my dream school, in a county where fire risks are high and there's somehow tornado warnings?? I have never before heard of a tornado in California and I am terrified of what this could mean for our infrastructure, which has been designed to withstand earthquakes, but never before this. I am terrified for the future of my state. We do not have time to continue with business as usual and save California. If our society continues the way it is going, we will lose this incredible, fruitful land.

This article really put the overall planet-wide characteristics of the climate crisis into perspective for me. While I knew that yes, eventually I would feel the effects of climate change, and likely sooner rather than later, I still had no idea just how close that day was. Nothing prepared me for the sheer failure of ourselves as environmentalists, trying to help Santa Barbara become greener. Even with as much as we say we are doing, we are not accomplishing. And even if we are accomplishing, it is not enough in a world full of pollution and CO2 use. This article really shows that whatever strives we make environmentally, we have to continue to make more and we have to spread this awareness and action to the rest of the world. If not, no where will get better, including us. We will be lost in the sea of fossil fuel societies at the same time much of our coastline may actually, literally be lost at sea. There is no option left but to change and to help others do so as well, or else even everything we do to become prepared will not be enough. It never will be.

The fact that Ventura County is the fastest warming county of the lower 48 states shocked me, I had no idea that our community is getting hit the hardest. Considering the fact that the mudslides and Thomas Fire hit Montecito / Santa Barbara area, which is a wealthier part of the country goes to show that climate change is going to be felt by all. It is easy for people to ignore when the seas are rising in Southeast Asia or there are sever droughts in Central Africa, but when it is in our backyards it cannot be ignored.

"Twodegrees beyond the limit" explains the impact of global warming on
California. It's sad to see what really happened in Santa Barbara until 2016,
and now, because of climate change, the new reality is that there is a wildfire
or some kind of environmental disaster every year. As an international student,
this is my fourth year in California. I have never felt that Santa Barbara's
environment is getting worse. It's sunny every day. The air is fresh. At least
compared with my hometown Beijing, the natural conditions here are really
wonderful. Of course, as a Chinese, I still love my motherland China the best Beijing
the best! I think it's a bad thing to let people know this tragic fact, because
Californians often focus on earthquakes and tsunamis, but our real focus must
be on destructive and deadly wildfires, which has become a harsh reality. I was
on the 101-freeway road to lax at fall 2018, which was full of smoke and fire.
This was not the paradise of California that I knew, but a scene of hell. After
driving to Ventura, we were told that 101 was blocked and we could only drive
to Los Angeles by a long mountain way. This is just my impression of a person
who has not been seriously affected by the fire. It's hard to imagine that
thousands of families have lost their homes in this disaster, which is very
terrible.
 <br><br>





What's more surprising to me is that if we don't take action until 2060, the coast of
Santa Barbara will be eroded by 78%, and half of IV and DP will be submerged.
For UCSB and its students, both IV and DP mean a lot. They are not only two
places, but also a kind of culture, a paradise for young people. It would be a
pity if they were really submerged.


 <br><br>



If the global temperature rises by two degrees Celsius, the sea level will rise by
56 cm in 2100, the glacier will rise by 6 cm, and the sea level will rise to
nearly one meter in 2300, which will be fatal.

The article “2°C: Beyond the limit” is really eye-opening. After reading this article, I realized that even for the residents living in the coastal area, the most serious consequence of climate change is not the rising of the sea level which may flood the coastal cities, but the soaring temperature. Compared to the pre-industrial time, the average temperature in Santa Barbara county has raised 2.3 degree Celsius, which exceeded the 2 degree Celsius which is the threshold temperature set by the Paris Agreement (America has withdrawn this agreement in 2019). In the article, what impressed me was that the government of Santa Barbara has done nothing to change the current condition. The county has pledged to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases by 15 percent compared with 2007, yet it actually rose up by 14 percent. Many of whom are aware about the consequences of climate crisis, but the mainstream seems to intentionally ignore that.

Reading article after article, lecture after lecture, post after post....there has consistently been one question that circles around in my brain. That question is simply why does the mass majority not see the BIG issue here? How do they not see that the climate is changing? How do they not see all this destruction? Why does it feel like no one even notices? I naturally came up with multiple conclusions. People are ignorant, people aren't educated on the topic, news media lies to the public, and last but not least, people just don't care. As all of these may be true, I think the biggest issue is people's inability to change. Im sure most people don't want to hear it, but they need to change the way they that they live! Or at the very least spread the word that climate change is very much real. Even I need to hear it. Climate change is an increasingly growing issue that will soon be a catastrophic event in our history. Just as the article and professor Hiltner stated, Santa Barbara, one of the most controlled climates in the world, is already having huge issues in its own backyard. Not only is this Mediterranean climate changing, this self-proclaimed environmentally friendly town is not who they say they are. As one of the leaders in the climate change movement, Santa Barbara fails to protect their own environment. Why? For the benefit of businesses and certain individuals? seems simply absurd to me. It's about time the average citizen no longer acts like an average citizen.

I found Scott Wilson's, "2° Beyond the limit" to be insightful and eye-opening.  It was surprising to read about how Ventura county is the fastest-warming county in all of the lower 48 states. It was more devastating to find out about the devastating effects that have already had on the citizens of this county.  Farmers have had to adapt to the rising temperatures by diversifying their crops; thus, switching from water-intensive plants to things like agave and dragonfruit. This has put a strain on these farmers who had previously had not had to deal with such harsh climate conditions.  What astonished me most was the hypocrisy of Santa Barbra County. As Wilson describes, Santa Barbra is the "Birthplace of the modern environmental movement" it has failed to follow through with its plans to combat climate change. They failed to reach their goal of limiting their greenhouse gas emissions and on top of that, officials have considered allowing more offshore oil drilling. I believe that if Santa Barbra claims that it wants to be a leader in the environmental movement then it should lead by example.

I was astonished to find out that my home town, Ventura, is the “fastest warming county in the lower 48 states.” Having lived in Ventura my whole life, being unaware of this fact is mind blowing to me. I remember when the all of the houses around mine burned down, then a few months later flooded. Did it not occur to anyone to alert the general public that this was solely the fault of climate change? And that if we took steps to change our lifestyle, we could greatly reduce the caliber of the coming environmental disasters? I remember hearing receiving “thoughts and prayers,” yet no one thought to educate the public on how to change this from becoming a constant reality. 
 <br><br>

I took environmental science in highschool and learned about climate change, but they lacked  telling us that our own county was heating fastest? Scott Wilson’s article “2 C: Beyond the Limit,” served as a real reality check to me because I had always thought Ventura was progressive in the environmental and conservation sector, however obviously something has gone awry if we are warming the fastest. This makes me wonder what the biggest contributor to the changing temperature is in the county, and if the residents of Ventura can change our lifestyle to have a  great impact, or if it is basically up to the big corporations to stop ruining the environment for their own profit. I also wonder, why Ventura? Ventura and Santa Barbara were both “stripped by fire, soaked by rain,” according to Scott Wilson, in 2017 and I didn’t feel any movements or great pushes to make changes to our lifestyle. 
 <br><br>

This makes me feel ignorant and embarrassed. 23 people died in Santa Barbara yet the main takeaway was sending “thoughts and prayers?” I feel so embarrassed that all of Ventura and Banta Barbara county didn’t take immediate action when lives were lost due to the obvious changing climate. We cannot wait any longer to make great changes.

“Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote”
 <br><br>

We have come to an age where we have grown numb to the catastrophes that seem to happen every day. We are used to wildfires, they are catastrophic events that happen regularly in our lifetime. We are used to seeing fires in the news, we are used to seeing floods and hurricanes that reach category five. These events are becoming so common that our reaction to them has come similar to the reaction we have when we hear an ambulance, slight concern for those affected, but not panic or unbearable sadness. We only have intense emotions where we are compelled to act when we hear personal stories of those who were affected. The sad reality is that we are used to things like droughts and animals decreasing in population and going extinct. One starts to understand the effects of the climate crisis not when we hear data, but when we connect to stories of those who have been affected by events caused by climate change, but this lethal apathy is still prevalent with big corporations because they are blinded by capitalism and greed. 
 <br><br>

Overall feeling after reading the article is disgust and anger. How can companies be so apathetic? How can they only care about the profit they are making? PG&E is saying things like “It’s an area we are working to improve” and “we’ve got a lot of folks working on things right now” these are rubbish answers. We have to hold the government, politicians,  accountable for allowing corporations to be so negligent by causing disasters like oil spills and fires AND for polluting the planet to the extent of world extinction.

It is astonishing and quite annoying that so many people who live in Santa Barbara claim to be against climate change yet are so unwilling to take significant steps to fighting it. While it may appear inconvenient to reduce parking or increase certain taxes, it is definitely far less inconvenient than the alternative that will come from the climate crisis. One would think that will the annual catastrophic weather events and fires there would be much more urgency to put a stop to it.

After reading the article, “2℃: Beyond the Limit” by Scott Wilson, I really found it interesting to see that the climate crisis was already here. Not in the sense that it has already begun happening, for it has been happening for many years, but to see that I would be directly affected by it so soon. Having lived in the Central Valley for the majority of my life, I believe I was a little numb to the idea that an area being so hot could be so detrimental to the way life responds. Summer’s for me are routinely above a hundred plus degrees Fahrenheit and life just seems normal, but this isn’t the way life is for everyone. While Kern County, the area where I am from, has had hundreds of years of experience to adapt to such extreme weather, other places have not. The article speaks about how heatwaves have been haunting Californians for the last few years, hurting both livestock and agriculture production heavily. The Santa Barbara County, in particular, is reeling heavily from these drastic weather changes as they are one of the main producers of avocado, a fruit that relies upon its ability to intake water, something with the recent wildfires and droughts the county is currently lacking. Wilson also highlighted the case of a farmer who focused on the winery business and how the fires have affected the power lines and essentially his business. Enter Larry Saarloos, a Santa Barbara resident and a man who has directly been affected by the climate crisis. Saarloos spent thousands of dollars to protect his vineyards from potential damage due to heatwaves only for PG&E to shut down power in his area and essentially leave his new protection not only ineffective but useless. I also found it really intriguing that Wilson basically called out all the fake activists in Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is often cited as a figure point in the Climate Crisis Movement for their role as the originators of Earth Day, but actions have shown that Santa Barbarians are more bark than bite. Countless “efforts” have been made to help fight the climate crisis but none have ever come to fruition. Activism is good in all when you are exactly what the word describes, you have to be active.

To start off, I am shocked. I honestly did not know very much about UCSB or the Santa Barbara area when I applied and even when I accepted. Out of the schools that I was accepted to, UCSB was the highest ranking and seemed to be a very pretty place to go. I was stunned when I first visited the campus. The drive up was magnificent and thee beaches and coastline was amazing. I was very excited to live in such an amazing location with perfect weather conditions.
 <br><br>
Initially, I I did not know much about the history of Santa Barbara until a friend of me told me about the oil spill and the left over tar. I wasn't sure if I believed it was a problem. I went to the beach and as I walked off the sand, I had thick goops of tar glued to my foot. I was shocked and irritated. the next time I went it happened again. It seemed so normal to people that the beaches were infested with tar and gunk. The erosion of the cliffs on campus is scary. Ive only been here for a quarter and Ive already seen the effects. Over the years, those cliffs will fall apart and start to eat away at campus and Isla Vista. That is terrible and a scary thought. Change needs to happen. Santa Barbara is very pretty yes, but they cant hide the fact that there are real problems going on in the county.



</p><hr>


<p>

This article partly shocked me and made me realize that the effects of climate change are very present in our lives. Not only is Santa Barbara still dealing with the effects of the oil spill over 50 years ago, but a hub for wildfires and blatant rising temperatures. I am now understanding more and more that people chose not to believe in climate change because they don't even understand it or because they don't see the actual effects in their lives. Climate is long term atmospheric conditions and weather is only short term. Although science can prove the actual climate change by the global temperature rise, people say this is the coldest winter they've ever had and disregard all evidence, when they aren’t even addressing climate, but weather. This is why I am still shocked that there isn’t more activism for the climate crisis right here in Isla Vista. 
 <br><br>
I was actually pleasantly surprised to read about the changes Ruskey and Hvolboll are hoping to make here in Santa Barbara, even as people of the older generation. This is the type of motivation we need all around the US and all around the world. Not only the Gen Z and Millenials that will be living with most of the effect of climate change, but also the boomers and Gen X should choose to make big changes for climate control despite the timing being in the later half of their life’s.
 <br><br>
The current problem is the section titled “No teeth in these plans”, because I think this is very representative of the rest of the country. Some county governments might not even have any plans or acknowledgement for the climate crisis, but what I found is Santa Barbara is all show. The article stated perfectly how Santa Barbara is a culprit of making everything look and seem environmentally friendly, but not really passing legislation that will slow climate change. The renewable resource plan for electricity is basically cancelled out by the lack of control or pushback on oil drilling and fracking.

After reading Scott Wilson’s “2C:” Beyond the Limit”, I was shocked by the fact that average temperature of Santa Barbara was risen over 2.5 degrees since 1895 and the neighboring city, Ventura, has rose about 2.6 degrees after the beginning of industrialization. This is a concrete and shocking statics. I realized why people or the government hesitated to have actions or policies toward the global warming climate after read this article. People cannot don’t do actions because they don’t see the results and they heard all the serious consequences just from the politicians and the newspaper. However, it is the people who need to change their lifestyle toward the problem of climate changes. This article lets me know that we have influenced the consequences of climate change and it has became more and more close to our life. Just in the fall quarter, it is the first time I was that kind of close to and threatened by the fire in Santa Barbara, and I heard that which have burned some faculties’ house. Santa Barbara is the most beautiful place I have been to with comfortable weather, blue sky and attractive beaches, but now the article told us that even the most beautiful place has been threatened. If the reason why people don’t do any action is that they didn’t see any changes, now they need to actually pay more attention to their behaviors.

I definitely agree that people need to start taking responsibility and to pay more attention to their behaviors. Whether it is the result of power companies and faulty hardware or someone throwing their cigarette into some dry brush, anything is enough to start a fire that could cover hundreds / thousands of acres of land, scorching everything and anything that is in its path. That's an insanely scary thought. Literally anyone can cause devastation to thousands of others with very little consequence since most environmental laws are unable to be strictly enforced. I'm also pretty shocked at the temperature changes that southern California is going through, especially since Ventura is among the highest of any state. In the article many other California counties were listed, and even my home of Orange County rose by 2.1 degrees Celsius since 1895, which is only 0.5 degrees Celsius less than the leading Ventura country.

Another thing that was super alarming was the fact that these fires were literally destroying countless farms and vineyards, and California accounts for almost half the US food supply. If this were to be destroyed, there is a good chance that we as a society will cut our lifespan even shorter than we are through the carbon emissions.

After reading Scott Wilson’s “2 C: Beyond the Limit” I feel consistently educated on the severity of this issue. What stood out to me, and perhaps this is a small detail, was the thirteen whales that washed up in San Francisco from starvation. That is just truly by definition insane. It makes it excruciatingly clear the damage we, as a country and as a species, are doing to this planet and other living animals. 
 <br><br>


I think it is hard to ignore the fact that California's worst three fires have happened in the past 2 years. I was visiting my family during the Camp fire and when the time came we too had to evacuate. It is a completely different experience from watching or reading the news and is surreal when you can see the flames personally and feel the urgency of packing up all your animals, crying because you haven’t heard from your mom, and even seeing an old childhood house burned down. What always blows my mind is the lake we grew up swimming in and the mountains we grew up hiking won’t look that way again in our lifetime. So many families and lives are robbed by these disasters. So many people did not have time to grab documents, photos, or even shoes. Hundreds of people were camped out in the Walmart parking lot homeless. 
 <br><br>


I hope people can start caring about climate change without having to first hand experience their town being on fire. I really like that Scott Wison points out Santa Barbara’s issues with oil drilling and car emissions. I think it is easy to say how other states or other people should change, but more difficult to reflect and bring change up oneself and one’s city.

The opening statement of your comment I found to be brutally honest: "it makes it excruciatingly clear the damage we" have caused. I think that most of the time we differentiate us from what the U.S has done to the planet but we must acknowledge that we are a part of the U.S, so we must change from the mindset of "them" to "use". We must take responsibility of what is happening to the world in order to properly make change.

This article really opened my eyes to everything that is going on around us. I can't believe that one of the most environmentally friendly places I have ever been to is one of the cities that is warming up the quickest. I figured that Santa Barbara would be warming at the normal rate or at an even slower rate. I thought that since we lived right next to the ocean that we wouldn't see any climate-related disasters, but I was wrong. 
<br><br>
This article made me sad because it didn’t give me any insight into how I could help out this community. I think this article would have been more effective if it showed us ways that could reverse the effects of climate and how we could slow down the heating. I feel like articles like this are important to show people all of the damage we are causing and how we are affecting more than just the climate, but all these articles only show the negatives. The last two articles have made me want to work hard to make a change, but they don't tell me how I play a part in reducing CO2 emissions.  I think that after reading an article like “2ºC: Beyond the limit” many people would be discouraged and believe that there is nothing they can do it help. Unless we start letting people know that change is possible and giving them ways to help make a change, I don't think many people will change how they live their lives.

“2°C: Beyond the limit”, was a very intriguing article, not only did it talk about the impacts of climate, but the center of the article is on Santa Barbara and Ventura County, which is now a new home for many people. It honestly shocked me when I read that Ventura was the fastest warming county in all of California. Another I found interesting while reading was when it mentioned how the cliffs in Del Playa are starting to erode and it’s crazy to think that in the coming years a lot of the homes there will disappear.
<br><br>
Something that also shocked me was the fact that 40 million of California’s residents now live in high-risk fire zones, and it’s sad to see how wildfires have become more common and just to even look back on the damage they have done.

Since I have never lived in Southern California until starting my campus life here, I used to think of California with words like sunshine, beach, and hot. After reading “2°C: Beyond the Limit”, I am totally shocked by the facts presented. The article depicts several catastrophic fires happened in Southern California, particularly in Santa Barbara, and the change in native climate and temperature, and criticizes a few plans and actions that the government took. I totally agree with what Das William has said that “before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote”. The actually happened catastrophes not only remind us of the “invisible” climate change but also promote us to fix the problem. The undeniable truth that Scott Wilson states alarms us that climate crisis is here, and it is not simply affecting us now, but affecting us in the long term.
<br><br>

The author depicts several huge fires and how some citizens dealt and felt about these. As far as people experience the consequences of climate change personally, they realize how severe and urgent the issue is. The fire that happened in November last year really astonished me since I never saw wildfire so closely and the scale of burning trees and mountains is so large and terrifying. We can say it is due to climate change and increasing temperatures, but after all, human activity causes and enlarges the issue.
<br><br>

The article criticizes the behavior of the government and claims that the government lacks responsibilities to help mitigate climate change and avoid larger effects carried by the climate crisis. Santa Barbara took a few actions to deal with greenhouse gas emissions, or just maintain it. The amount of release even increases by 14 percent in 2017 compared with its levels in 2007. Although claims like “caring more about how it looks than how it lives” and “environmental poseurs” sound satiric, government and related agencies need to reflect and really need to take action instead of waiting for further calamity happened.

The article "2'C: Beyond the limit" explores the issues regarding climate change in our own backyard--Santa Barbara. As an incoming freshman, I remember the excitement I felt when I realized I was moving to "Sunny Santa Barbara." I was excited to be a part of the community, to experience its beauties and grow here. Little did I know that as I was growing, Santa Barbara was crashing. I remember being at Portola, where there is a great view of the mountains, watching the city go up in flames. It was helplessly growing--every second damaging our home more and more. After reading this article, along with joining English 23, I've realized that as students who benefits greatly from this town, we are obligated to help provoke and make changes. It's truly terrifying to know that a place known for it's beauty, weather, attractions, etc. can all come to an end. Us students are lucky enough to live in this city before some of the detrimental effects of climate change take place, so preventative action from each and every student is necessary. 
<br><br>
This "temperature rise" is certainly not just that. Farmers are experiencing a decline in their crops due to the extreme weather changes, bird population is being affected, the foundation of many houses are eroding from rising sea levels. This article does a good job at reminding us community members that Santa Barbara needs our help. It's frustrating that a lot of the principle issues are out of our hands--like the county passing oil projects that'll tremendously increase the amount of greenhouse gas we emit--but it should fire us up to come together and find new ways that students, staff, and community members can prevent the destruction of our home.

This week’s article served as a reminder that climate change is not some distant thing that we can just carry on ignoring. It is happening everywhere, even in our own backyards on Del Playa Drive. And instead of fighting against it, we are simply preparing for the inevitable wildfires and various other natural disasters while we carry on living luxuriously. Instead, we should be making important lifestyle changes to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and save our planet.

I have lived in Santa Barbara County my entire life and the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit” really opened my eyes to the fact that although we claim to be working towards sustainability we are still hypocrites. This county publicly says all of these nice things about wanting to be the first to use 100-percent sustainable energy by 2030 and although some efforts have been made, we are ignoring the bigger picture. Just like the article mentions, how are we going to support one aspect of being sustainable but also support oil drilling and the making of more parking garages?

<br><br>
This article made me feel sad about what’s to come because although Santa Barbara is a beautiful city this may not still be true 20 years from now if we don’t make changes in the way we are living. I get that some people are not willing to give up the lifestyle they are currently living but hello, do you not see the implications this has on our planet?  We have experienced multiple natural disasters yet people are still not willing to create change. It’s sad to see how the homes on DP will no longer be there one day and how our beaches will not be filled with as much life anymore yet there's still people who are in denial about the climate crisis when the effects are literally in our backyard.

I agree with you in regard to the green initiative of hypocrisy. Although the Santa Barbara County and California in general really claim to be progressive in fighting climate change, there is still a lot being done within the state that thwarts the goal towards sustainability. For example, the attempt to turn parking lots into homes, which would theoretically decrease the number of cars being used, was denied because “the business community says is key to profitability.” Unfortunately, this is one hypocrisy that demonstrates that even a progressive state like California still prioritizes profitability over combating climate change. This is extremely saddening to me because California is a beautiful state that is already being physically affected by climate change. As mentioned before, fire season is now all year round and tornadoes, something very uncommon for California, is now being created near. I cannot help but feel pessimistic about saving California since it is true that even though we are seeing the effects, people are still not willing to make a lifestyle change. And by the time everyone realizes that a lifestyle change is a necessity to save the planet, I fear it will be too late for California. I do not mean that California will be completely destroyed but rather that the locus amoenus we know will be gone.

Wilson's article was interesting in that it communicated the effects of rising global temps in areas where much if this class calls home (for about 4 years, at least). This reporting is complete with data visualization and stories from people from all different professions/lifestyles - from students at UCSB on DP to a La Paloma Ranch manager. While this idea of climate change already being here both spatially and temporally is not new to me, it is still eye-opening to have it all laid out. In that sense I am also really grateful that this article was written as I think it is all a tool that we can use when we are having discussions with people about the effects of climate change and they might need a little more convincing (we all know at least of those in our lives.)
<br><br>
I thought Leah Stokes' comment on Santa Barbara being "not nearly as progressive as we think" regarding the county's devotion to protecting the environment especially notable, and one specific case came to mind that was discussed in another one of my classes. We talked about the "Light Blue Line" project which was a plan to paint a blue line across the SB downtown/city area where a 21m sea level rise would effectively come up to (a prediction from 2007 that pretty much matches the most recent 2018 city report). Unfortunately it was shot down in the final stages of planning due to pushback from property owners that argued it would unfairly lower the value of their properties. Given all the hurdles that a project like this would have to jump in order to be completed, I am surprised that it even got that far but not surprised that money was the driver for the lack of action. While I think the SB community as a whole has shown its devotion to environmental protection, I would hope to see the support continue even when it is not as convenient. (article about the blue line project here: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-aug-26-me-blueline26-story.html)

I definitely agree with many of the points you have made and feel this article is a great tool that can be used to start a conversation about climate change and its direct effects on the Southern California coastal region and many Santa Barbara and Ventura residents. Although I think this article brought up many interesting points about how climate change is already affecting the area and the lack of political support to make changes, I feel as if this article could have been more effective if it also talked about how and what individuals can do within their daily lives to help combat climate change. I think that if the politicians are unwilling to make changes or enforce rules that deal with rising sea levels or temperature rise, local residents and community members will need to demand changes to unsure their livelihoods and the future of the area. This area is known for its environmental activism so after reading this article it was a bit disheartening to realize that Santa Barbara may care more about its reputation than actually making changes to prevent further climate impacts. 
<br><br>

I also am glad you brought up the "Light Blue Line" project. I think that this is such an interesting concept that could have really started a conversation that needs to happen right now. If people saw what could potentially happen to their city I think they would be more inclined to take action and promote changes that help battle climate change. Again though, this project is a perfect example of how money and political power can create leverage against environmental activism. It also backs what the article was suggesting, that Santa Barbara cares "more about how it looks than how it lives" and sadly this hypocrisy could lead to many negative climate events.
<br><br>

Hopefully, after all the fires and floods that have devastated the Santa Barbara and Ventura areas, people realize how dire this situation is and will want to make changes individually and and as a community.

After reading “2 degrees beyond the limit” and Ken’s video, I feel really sad to see these disasters happened in Santa Barbara and Ventura county. I’m a senior at UCSB, which means I have experienced most of the wildfires in the recent three years. Until 2016, where was rarely wildfires happened around this area. The only environmental disaster that bothered people in Santa Barbara may be the earthquake. On the other hand, people now have to face the truth of the frequent wildfire which could happen any time. I’m overwhelmed by a lot of shocking statistics and facts mentioned in the reading such as Ventura is the top one region with the most extreme Li mate changes in the U.S. I mean, it’s only 35 miles away from UCSB. I’m now really become to worry about the climate change because the change is so close to me.

I agree, the fires that happened in Santa Barbara and Ventura are really sad. But what’s worse is that there have been fires all over the state of California. Fires in California are now becoming a norm. My family is from Sonoma County, up in Northern California, where the recent Kincade Fire nearly burned 80,000 acres. Living in Sonoma my whole life, I am able to see the vast changes and disasters that are in relation to climate change. Specifically, in Sonoma, climate change negatively impacts agriculture, which causes great loss to the industries. California agriculture will soon suffer at a greater costs of climate change when it will be unable to provide the same amount it used to. I couldn’t agree more that the facts and statistics are shocking and alarming, but even though this article was about nearby counties, it’s important to acknowledge that it’s not just happening in Santa Barbara County or Ventura County, it’s happening across the state, and across the world.

<p>
After watching the article "2C: beyond the limit" by  Wilson together with the video posted, I found the fact which really shocks me is that we can truely feel the bad effects
brought by globel warming and the rising temperature instead of the terrible numbers and statistics found by the researches. It's true that we cant actually feel the rising of 
temperature by 2~3C, however we could feel the effect of climate change when disasters such as floods, tornados and drought happens. As mentioned in the video, people 
could actually be scared by the terrible effects brought by tornados and by that time people would start to be worried about the climate change. 
<br><br>
What's more, I am shocked by the fact that SB claims to care about the climate change and has plan about how to protect the environment while there's actually not. And 
as mentioned, SB produces over half of the fruits and nuts to the world hence extremely big problems might happen when the environment is affected by climate change to 
reduce the production of fruits and nuts. Thus more facts should be posted to inform people about the possible bad effects of climate change and globel warming.

This article made me realize how hypocritical the city of Santa Barbara is. After the 1969 oil spill, the climate change movement started and Earth Day was founded. That being said, as the article states, Santa Barbara isn’t doing much to contribute to the cause, with an average warming of 2.3 degrees Celsius. SB should be paving the way and leading by example. This city has been hit with so many climate change related problems, including the Thomas Fire in 2017, temperature super spikes, warmer, dryer weather, the Cave Fire just last quarter that canceled school, and just recently, a tornado warning. 
<br><br>
Having grown up in Southern California my whole life, I’ve been able to witness these changes pretty much first hand. These changes only started becoming substantial during high school, but since then, they’ve come full force. A few summers ago, I started noticing how much hotter it was than it used to be. Then, when winter would come, I noticed how much less it rained. The most apparent changes were the wildfires that started becoming a yearly occurrence. The Woolsey Fire in 2018 was something I’ll never forget. It affected people I knew, many of my friends having to evacuate. I remember driving down the PCH on my way to swim practice and seeing the sky tinted orange. School and swim were canceled for days.
<br><br>
This article should be a wake up call for anyone living in Santa Barbara or California in general. Climate change is here and is here to stay. We’re seeing direct consequences of the crisis happening in our backyard, and still, so little progress is being made.

<p>
As an international student who has only lived in Santa Barbara for around two years, I’ve already fell in love with the weather, almost no where I have visited could top this place. But what I did not expect when coming to this place was the deteriorating environment that climate crisis has brought upon this beautiful county. I have learned much more from the reading, I was not aware of how important California was to the food production of the United States, and neither did I know that the farmers’ conditions are at an all time low. During last quarter when the mountain fires got visibly close to our school, I was very afraid that this would be the end, I have never seen forest fires at such a scale and that also became one of the reasons I signed up for this course. It is definitely terrible how the effects of climate change are on a global scale, but it is much worse when they are right outside my doorstep. I hate to see anything around me torn apart by natural disasters, and as an individual, I have been trying my best to limit my contribution to climate change.

It is strange how much climate change has affected me. With the temperature rising consistently, back home we are always surrounded by fires. Unfortunately, I live right outside of the mountains so in the valley area and every year between June-September there are consistently fires. This has been happening since about the summer of 2015. At the time I didn't realize that this was happening due to the rise in temperature. After reading the article "2°C: Beyond the Limit" I came to the realization that climate change has been affecting us for quite some time without even knowing it.
<br><br>

After reading the article I was shocked to know that Ventura was the fastest temperature rising city within the lower 48 states of the US. I was so shocked about this because coming from a desert and seeing how much hotter it gets every summer I would think that most of Southern California would have the highest rise of temperature. Living in the High Desert and seeing our average temperature being 1010-1030 F every summer and then having recorded this last summer where it reached 1100-1150 F for a few days straight was eye-opening.
<br><br>

It is sad to think that future generations, our kids are going to have to face a world that we knew before all of this started happening. What is even sadder and depressing to think about, is that all kids who were born 2010 and later only know of the state of the world we are in now. It will not only affect our future generations, our kids and our kids’ kids, but it has already started affecting the generation that is growing up right now. Some of these kids don’t even remember a time where there weren’t fires happening every year or remembering a time where it wasn’t so hot when it was supposed to be cool.

After I read the article “2°C: Beyond the limit” and watching Ken’s video, I am surprised by how climate change impacts our lives. The article indicates that the temperature in southern California has increased 2ºC on average. As a UCSB student who currently resides in Santa Barbara, this is somewhat heartbreaking. What we do in our daily life will impact our environment. The wildfire, the drought, the hurricanes in recent years are closely related to the increased global temperature. I still clearly remember the cave fire in Santa Barbara last December, yet that was not the biggest wildfire in this area. If we do not take action right now, I am sure there will be more and more catastrophes waiting for us in the future.




</p><hr>


<p>
Reading the article was somewhat alarming. I knew that California was heating up, but I was not aware of the severity of this specific area. I also find it more scary because now I live in the Santa Barbara county. I am only a freshman and I have been here only since September  and I already experienced my first fire in December 2019. I live in the inner cities of LA, so yes I hear about fires all the time, but they never reach me. Then I move here and the school had to stop class because of the smoke from the fire, it was the first time I actually saw a wildfire, which looked like flames from hell. It also makes me feel bad for the people who live right there and the international students or just students that cannot evacuate so easily.

Having grown up in Ventura County my whole life, I have been able to see all these drastic changes first hand. As a kid, I remember a few fires sparking around where I lived. However, this was just a result of the dry fire-season climate. These were contained quickly and I never felt any danger. When I entered high school is when these fires began to take a turn for the worse. Leading up to junior year of high school, I remember multiple strings of very hot days that cut our school days short. This should have been a sign for what was to come. In 2017, the Thomas Fire broke out and devastated thousands of acres, homes, and livelihoods. Many of my close friends and their families were directly impacted by the fire, leaving them with nothing. The smoke from the Thomas Fire spread out all over the county and the air quality was affected significantly. School was cancelled for multiple days and life was stopped to a halt. After what felt like months passed, the Thomas Fire was finally put out. Then came the mudslides. Again, thousands of livelihoods were destroyed. It felt endless, despite not being affected too directly. I remember watching the news and seeing the 101 covered entirely with mud. After the mudslides, life finally seemed to return to 'normal' -- or at least people had come to accept the new reality. Then, in late 2018, the Hill and Woolsey Fire broke out very close to home. The Hill Fire, while significantly smaller, was scarier for me since it started only a couple of miles away. Hill Canyon was a local hiking spot and it was burning. I looked outside my house and saw my mountain sides on fire. All it took was for the wind to shift and the Hill Fire would have been coming straight towards my house and my livelihood. Luckily, the Hill Fire was contained rather quickly, at least in comparison with other fires. The Woolsey Fire continued to burn and it felt just like the Thomas Fire, but just south of my home. If it wasn't for the fire reaching the coastline, it would have just kept burning. Like the Thomas Fire, it destroyed thousands of acres, homes, and livelihoods. 2017 and 2018 opened my eyes to the climate crisis and I realized that things are only going to get worse.

2°C: Beyond the limit<br><br>

By reading the article and watch the Youtube video about how the 2°C increased temperature could make a catastrophic consequences that cause climate crisis; it is very educational since most people still refuse to admit the existence of global warming could actually bring enormous negative effect by ignoring poor air quality and rising sea levels. In the article, due to the significant climate change (2.3 degrees Celsius higher since 1895) that cause the Sherpa Fire and place the Santa Barbara residential in a high-risk living environment, climate change is causing dramatic fiscal input for the region. Forests are hardly adapting such changes that losing 43% of initial living species not only because of forest fire but also in daily. People should pay attention to the climate change even though technology such as air conditioning could ease the heat, those 2°C could cause more than people expected of climate crisis. 
<br><br>

Quoted from the article “Rapid warming and extreme weather have affected the coastal sweep from Santa Barbara to San Diego counties. The 2018 Woolsey Fire in Malibu killed three people and torched over 1,600 buildings. (Kyle Grillot for The Washington Post)” indicates the danger of less moisture in the air that cause high-risk of fire of the region is an alarm to people. Residential region used to aside forests is no longer a good place for people that live there for decades.

After reading “22°C: Beyond the limit, I was interested in how the climate temperature increases which is causing more tremendous fires and threats  in Southern California. I was alarmed how as time continues, the weather gets hotter and hotter leading to more threatening frightening events. It is sad to say how “43% of their species are being lost” due to these conditions.With the temperature rising, this leads to more droughts and causing more overwhelming events to occur. The depressing thing is that the government only focuses on the minor solutions after the event and not solving the main problem that causes the climate increasing temperatures. It is sad to see how they spend money on how to rebuild the roads or fixing up the buildings. We should cure the wound instead of just putting a bandaid on it. We should reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This will lead to actually fixing the result and avoiding any tragic situations.
   <br><br>
      It is also interesting to me how all the parts of the world will be affected since it is a global issue. It is surprising how as time continues, the fires are more likely to occur and making it harder to survive. I was so overwhelmed how there are more tragic events to occur since the temperature is sky-rocking. When the fire that occured in Santa Barbara, it made me realize how anything is possible and it matters on how we will react to these situations and how any part is affected with this kind of event.. If we don’t resolve this matter, this will make things at least 10 times worse. In addition, the greenhouse gas emissions will cause more problems in this world.

I do agree that this was definitely an interesting read indeed. 
   <br><br>

"With an average temperature increase of 2.6 degrees celsius since preindustrial times, Ventura ranks as the fastest-warming county in the Lower 48 states." 
   <br><br>

This quote from "2°C: Beyond the limit" by journalist Scott Wilson isn't the most reassuring statement in the world, and it shouldn't be. The climate crisis is real, and this quote from the reading is something I definitely didn't know prior to reading the article. It's especially important because the Ventura county neighbors ours.
   <br><br>

It's very important that you mentioned how climate change is a global issue. I'm glad you brought that point up because it really is and I feel that a large percentage of the US population in particular is guilty of not understanding the severity of the climate crisis. Because it isn't visibly happening, doesn't mean it isn't happening, and more importantly, doesn't mean it's not happening anywhere else.

Santa Barbara was very appealing to me because I thought that the city and the school were very environmentally progressive especially UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science which was named the first building in the nation to receive a platinum LEED rating, basically, the Bren School is the “greenest” lab in the nation. But after reading the article, not so much anymore. I’m learning and noticing now that Del Playa is slowly withering away and soon it will just disappear altogether! Even just looking at the photo of the house in Del Playa, you can tell where the house used to stand on; the house was not built on an edge intentionally, the eroding cliff fell apart, causing the ledge on the underside of the house. What stood out to me in the article was the report that revealed Santa Barbara had exceeded their 2007 greenhouse emissions by 14% when the city had pledged to reduce their 2007 numbers by 15%. By 2050 (30 years from now), SB will have double the amount of hot days which seems so bizarre to me-- summers are hot enough, we don’t extra days to shrivel up. Chief Executive Trent Robbins says that there is a lack of preparedness and this is true. What will the city do when we get another fire like the Thomas Fire? Has the city been prepared in future disasters? In the rate that Santa Barbara and Ventura are heating up, we could be burning up later this year where all we can do is evacuate instead of starting with little things like biking, eating less meat, and importantly, saving or conserving water.

When people begin to think of the effects of climate change, everyone views the topic as coming-if at all- in many years. Practically ignoring the possibility that changes in our environment is even possible. Yet as time passes it is quite obvious that we live in a multitude of disasters and some literally hitting closer to home; such as the fires this past November. Knowing that fires have been so constant that they are considered a norm is terrifying to consider. Knowing my home, LA and Santa Barbara are in constant danger- especially being seen in more recent events. Fire? Flood? Tornados? Is that what we have to look forward to? Natural damages destroying more lives than we could even feel sorrow for and that seem to reck the mentality of those who do are not blissfully ignorant on what is to come. As a student of climate change, we are painfully aware of what more could come. 
   <br><br>

Our beach side houses are literally disappearing from under us. Houses will fall into the ocean and as a literal beachside campus, we should be afraid. We should be afraid that we as people and a community are not working harder to improve our conditions. Rising sea levels can possibly lead to the destruction of our school. I definitely feel that the lack of response to climate change in Santa Barbara county is really devastating and honestly not very wise. If the university would cease to exist because of rising sea levels, cliffs falling and detrimental weather patterns, I feel the economy for the county will diminish because the university brings so many jobs and people to the economy. So would the city really want to not do anything to stop climate change or is it just another "future" problem?
   <br><br>

I suppose that one of the things that contribute to my frustration is that there are so many aspects of the consequences of climate change that they are present and it always seems that greed is behind it. Greed in the way that the 3rd largest oil spill causes the tar on our feet when at the beach so many years later explicitly shows that the things we do have a longstanding effect on the future generations.

I find it interesting that like you, a lot of us are aware of that there have been a lot of natural disasters occurring within the last decade or so, yet there is very little action. As people we want to believe that these disasters are supposed to happen, because it makes it easier to get on with our life.
   <br><br>


I completely agree, the lack of response to the natural  disasters already occurring due to climate change is very frustrating. i think that maybe part of the reason there is such a lack of response even when the disasters keep occurring all around us is not only greed, but also the fact that its being normalized. Whenever  I talk to climate change deniers about climate change, they tend to explain away the extreme natural disasters as part of a "cycle" that the earth goes through. I can't help but feel like we all want to believe that all these fires, and receding shoreline are just normal, all because we don't want to feel constantly alarmed, and we end up normalizing what's happening. So yes, greed is a large part of the problem, but we also have to consider that it's not always greed. Sometimes it's fear that causes people to shy away from calling climate change what it is when we see a fire because believing it's "normal" or "supposed to happen" is a lot easier than realizing the  big suck that we are in.

I remember around the same time during Christmas how news broke of a tornado warning for the Anaheim/ Garden Grove area. I was scared for my roommates who were there, and this wasn’t the first time I was worried about a natural disaster affecting the lives of the people I’ve met at UCSB. In early October of last year, a fire was happening in Sylmar, so close to my home and in the same city where my friend lives. Thankfully her home was ok, but the fires and everything is just getting too normalized in the sense that it happens every few months.
   <br><br>
Just recently I was hanging out with my friend over winter break, and she took me to a spot she loved on the mountains in Porter Ranch overlooking the San Fernando Valley, and everything around us was dead. She told me how the houses across the street from her were burning, but the fact that her place was so close scared me. We were standing in what was left from the fire.
   <br><br>
My favorite bit from the article “2°C: Beyond the limit” was when it mentioned Santa Barabara’s hypocrisy regarding action because it reminded me how everything and everyone is kind of hypocritical when it comes to making significant action. Myself included, in a case where I have the option to buy used clothing at a thrift store but sometimes opt for new instead. Where we have power, we should use it to the max that we can. Even though I’m one person and it can feel hopeless, changing my diet can help. Buying used clothes and donating my old ones will help even a little bit. Sadly, we’re far past the era of little things going a long way. It essentially comes down to leaders in politics who have that power, and a city like Santa Barabara needs to do better.

This article has a unique approach that discusses the impact of climate change in Santa Barbara explicitly. Based on a recent study, Santa Barbara will have the number of extremely hot days that are likely to double by 2050, and cliff erosions may contribute to one of the severe issues that people have to move out of their houses. Besides, there will be more prolonged drought and more frequent, which concerns the residents. The farmers have a nearly 5% decline in revenue due to extreme weather and events. The shift of plantation begins to happen as avocado and other plants are water-intensive crops, so they begin to diversify plants include dragon fruit and Agave. Additionally, the climate conditions threaten coastal redwood forest, Joshua trees of the southern desert and kelp forest of the warming ocean, and diverse species. Global warming negatively impacted all livings on earth. 

   <br><br>

Furthermore, since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara county has warmed by 2.3 degrees, which further enhances the risk of wildfire. In 1969, there was the third-largest oil spill in U.S. history that spilled 3 billion barrels of oil. Our human-caused devastation to the environment is the core and reason for the unusual climate conditions. Accordingly, we truly need governmental regulations on business and individuals, which officially sets punishments rather than setting rules orally. Ironically, with no mandatory laws,  the company proposes new oil projects, and the public discusses climate action plan at the same time. Thus, we, as a responsible human, should let the government and more people to hear our voice and stands, which fights for the environmental campaign. We should act now.

I enjoyed reading this article because it’s so informational and detailed. Since I’m not from Santa Barbara or even California, I didn’t have a really clear concept about Santa Barbara’s environmental conditions and how severe the wildfires were until reading this article and watching professor’s video. I’ve never encountered any wildfire back in my hometown since it’s always cold and snowy in winter and has a mild temperature in summer. For this reason, before I came to California for college, wildfire sounds like something scary but very far away from my own life. I love how the article focusing on the temperature raising in Santa Barbara and Ventura; this made me realize how close I am to the current environmental issues. I was surprised that there are much more people living in the high-risk fire zones than I thought. I had heard about California’s wildfire back when I was in high school, but when I’m experiencing it in person, I was terrified. 

   <br><br>

What’s more, I feel so related to the oil-spilling accident and the temperature difference in a day because that’s my most disliked thing about Santa Barbara. I could not believe my eyes when I saw there was tar on the sole of my sandals when I got back from the beach at the beginning of this school year. And I can't remember how many times I'll complain to my friends about the temperature that makes it hard for me to pick proper outfits for the day.

The article “2°C: Beyond the Limit” was shocking to read. I knew that climate change was here as I feel the heat in my hometown Bakersfield go up each year. Breaking records for the hottest summer one after the other. However, I was more surprised about the farmers and businesses that simply adapted and found new ways to make money from the climate changing. Instead of trying to find ways to help the crisis, they just find new ways to profit from the ever-changing climate. I wonder how many other companies do the same thing and just change products for monetary gain. I understand that they need to change their ways to make a living but if the climate has changed so much in such a same amount of time. When will they need to switch to another product. They need to address the problem before even switching the product isn’t enough. The fires, rising sea levels, and the erosion happening in the past decade is a sign that climate change is here. Climate Change is happening now and we need everyone, even companies to help before the crisis gets worse.

I also found it super intriguing that people only adapted to continue profiting off the changing climate. I understand that business owners need to take money to survive, but it is the lack of action and a lack of voice for change is the exact reason we have gotten to the point that we are right now. Because people are complacent and resistant to changing their habits, the crisis is just getting worse. Eventually people are going to need to face the issues with their actions head on, but most people have not yet done so. People are only fueled by economic interest, and seem not to care about their affects on the climate and in turn others.

   <br><br>

While people feel removed from the issue of climate change, the consequences are obvious already. the coastal erosion on the Del Playa bluffs, the hotter summers every year, and rising sea levels, are all clear examples of how our actions are affecting the environment around us. I believe the reason people are so complacent is because of the people around then not changing either. If everyone changed, then with them cultural acceptance of actions affecting the environment would change. The tragedy of the commons is the reason people are so unwilling to change.

Although I know that global warming is affecting us, I don't know that global warming has reached and affected our backyard. 
in this video “2ºC: Beyond the Limit", I had no idea that there are a couple places in California that have already surpassed  2 degree limit, and our home Santa Barbara is one of them. I can't agree more with this view：Edward France “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something”, people are always good at pretending care about the climate change, but when the cost of protecting environment rise, fewer people will still insist on protecting environment with action. This does not mean that protecting the environment is not important, but that it requires people to have a greater perspective. when stopping  drive  can reducing emission of Green house gases, would you willing to wake up 20 or more mins early to ride to school? when eating meat will cost a high emission of CO2, would you stop eat meat and be   a 
 vegetarian? when we already have enough clothes to wear, Wouldn't you buy new clothes until the clothes are worn out? 
I know it's hard to do, but that doesn't mean we don't need to work hard to protect the environment. 
It takes our courage, persistence and wisdom to do it. If we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can reduce the chance of forest fires and the number of houses that are burned. If we live a little frugally, future generations can breathe healthy air. If we take environmental issues early and take action, maybe those koalas in Australia will not be killed by the fire. If a little change can reduce the chance of disaster, why not take action?

There is an important distinction to make between this week's reading "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" and last week's reading "The Uninhabitable Earth." "The Uninhabitable Earth" targets a larger audience. David Wallace-Wells describes the different catastrophic alternatives that our world might follow if we do not act as soon as possible. In contrast, "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" tailors itself to  a more local and concentrated audience. This is important because as we have seen, people often ignore what is happening at a global scale because of the way they think. They think that they will never experience such climate threats in their lives. It is only when we see that our own populations, communities and ecosystems are suffering from the impact of climate change, that we think more deeply about what we are doing to our world. This week's article targets the community of California to inform them about catastrophic events that have occurred in recent years. Also, it compares the way ancestors lived to today's life which can be summarized in one  word: hell.
    <br><br>

With increasing fires across California, many people and animals have lost their lives. It is emphasized that Ventura county is the fastest-warming county across the nation and I shouldn't have to tell you how alarming that is. California has once been thought of a predictable place to live, yet recent years have shown that this is not the case anymore. Because of this uncertainty, Californians now live in fear, anticipating to evacuate and escape horrifying fires such as the Thomas fire in 2017. Furthermore, not only is fire our main concern but also draughts, floods, and earthquakes. Like I've mentioned, we live in hell and that is absolutely terrifying. I did not know that California provided the U.S with about half of the nuts, vegetables and fruits grown in the U.S. The problem with this is that if California suffered more catastrophes due to climate change, then not only will we suffer but people across the nation will as well.
    <br><br>

There was a quote that struck me the most when I was reading this article: "We're always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something." This is absolutely true. People often enough notice that something is up with climate change and may decide to do something about it. However, as soon as they find out that change requires sacrifices such as changing diets, investments, giving up things we love to do or eat, they tend to look the other way and create a life in which climate change is not an urgent issue that needs to be taken care of. The article mentions that Santa Barbara is the place where the modern environmental movement was created and has fallen short on preventing pollution. This brings up the question: if such a place with strong environmental convictions cannot reduce their own pollution, how is the rest of the world going to do it? We have to work together as a community to bring change to our own homes and move upward to the rest of the world.
    <br><br>

Let's change how the world views Santa Barbara from a place where we "only care more about how it looks than how it lives." If we do this, then the rest of California can follow, then other states will, more nations as well and finally the entire world. Let's be the building blocks of a new change.

In the article "2ºC: Beyond the Limit", by Scott Wilson, Wilson shows how the climate crisis is affecting parts of Santa Barbara and how Ventura is heating up quicker than other counties. In my opinion, I feel that this article was very effective in communicating how climate change is affecting Santa Barbara in a major way. It is effective because of the use of graphs and maps that depict approximately how much temperature has changed in a certain region and which areas have had fires because of this issue. I fail to understand how people continue to believe that climate change is not an issue when the coast is eroding to the point where people will eventually lose their homes if they reside near a cliff and the severity of fires are worsening. People's lives are being taken because of this issue yet those who can do something about it continue to turn their heads. I feel that Santa Barbara needs to help do something about the climate change instead of solely caring about how everything looks and switch to renewable energy. I find it very ironic that Santa Barbara cares about the way their scenery looks, but the scenery will not look very well if people are losing their homes on the coast and fires continue to grow and become harder to maintain. I was shocked in the article to see the picture of the house in Isla Vista where part of the house had no cliff to support it. The oil spill that occurred in 1969 worsened the areas climate situation because of all the emissions that were released. Whenever I go to the beach, it is very rare that I don't come back to my dorm without tar on the bottom of my feet. This article really alarms me because if this situation is to worsen then many people will be affected including many of the students in this class. The article mentions part of Del Playa becoming non existent due to erosion. This is scary because if the coast of Del Playa is eroding than the coast of UCSB will most likely erode along with it.

Before reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit”, I, like many others thought that the biggest impact of climate change in California would be the rise of sea levels. However, after reading this article, I realize that the impacts go way beyond this. The recent rise of natural disasters in central and southern California show that climate change can effect much more – from wildfires, to extraordinary patterns (such as the tornado in Santa Barbara), to “global weirding”. If effects of the unusual rise of temperature in Ventura County is at all indicative of what rising temperatures can cause worldwide – the rest of the world should embrace for drastic circumstances in the near future.
    <br><br>
The part of the article that I found most eye-opening was when Wilson discussed the apartment buildings and bluffside beaches near UCSB. At times, when people discuss climate change, I sometimes tend to have the  wrong mindset of “this is horrible, but I know it won’t affect me personally”. However, the example of the apartment building collapsing on Del Playa, one street down from where I live, and the prediction that 78% of the bluffside beaches could be eroded away by 2060 is both alarming and saddening. If climate change continues as it has in recent years, UCSB and the surrounding areas could look very different by 2060. 
    <br><br>
Although the article did a good job of delivering important statistics, data, and examples, I felt that it did not do enough to provide ways for us to help, creating a “hopeless” attitude. People need to know that there is still time to make changes and curb the effects of climate change as we move forward into the future. Providing this sense of concern, yet hope for the future is important to motivate people to take action.

Hi! I can also relate to the idea that the biggest effect for California would be the rise in sea levels. But I also quickly learned reading this article that there are many other aspects that are affecting the area. In addition, I also found it incredibly sad to think that by 2060 78% of the bluff side could become eroded. This week I was walking on the beach and I looked up to some of the houses that have clear visible damage from the loss of bluffs and it really makes the reality set in, this is happening right in front of us, so what can we do, how can we save the places that we have and are growing up in? From the wildfires to the mudslides to the bluffs collapsing it really makes me think can California survive climate change?


<br><hr>
I agree with you.  Before reading this article, I was not aware of how apparent climate change is today. I did not realize how much natural disasters are occurring in our own state. When I read about the erosion of the bluff side beaches of UCSB, I felt afraid for what will happen to our beautiful campus. I also felt the same as you did, I knew that climate change was happening but I didn't think it would affect me personally. But after reading about the tragedy that happened when one of our apartment buildings crumbling into the cliff under it, I realized that climate change will affect me and everyone else.  I couldn't imagine  what will happen to Del Playa by 2060. I also agree with you in that the article was not very optimistic. It did not provide any solutions and overall gave off a very pessimistic tone. I did appreciate that it provided many statistics and examples and I am sure this article opened the eyes of many other readers.

Reading articles like “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" make me realize why scientists suggested the new moniker climate "crisis". Sometimes it's hard to imagine that anything could go wrong in the idyllically beautiful landscape of Santa Barbara. That's probably why I was so stricken by the truth in Scott Wilson's quote; "Santa Barbara is often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives".  I was honestly shocked to learn about our county's consistent failure with lowering our greenhouse gas emissions. The image portrayed by the city is often one of climate awareness and action, yet in actuality we continue to fall short of those marks on many accounts. It's really disappointing to realize that the place I call home is not doing as much for our climate as I once thought. 
<br><br>
It is a sickening and frustrating reality that this self-fueled crisis is destroying our own backyards, and yet mainstream media continues to prioritize news about the royal family's latest drama. The fires affecting our area are terrifying, especially considering "the three most severe in state history — measured by acreage burned, homes destroyed and lives lost — have happened in the past two years".  The implications erosion, drought and wildfire pose for the future of my school and community are heartbreaking. The fact that I might not be able to show my grandchildren the place I went to college is devastating.

Your last point really hit home, especially for all UCSB students, where we may not be able to show our grandchildren our alma mater. The beautiful beaches below Del Playa and Del Playa itself will be eroded and go away. It is also something to consider what will happen to the iconic UCSB lagoon. Will it be swamped itself by the ocean and rising sea level? As the professor said in the video, many people are worried about the rising sea levels with climate change, which will for sure cause these problems said above. In the article as well, the writer mentions how one apartment has already been condemned, and fences and support systems are being put in place for the cliffs. This will surely not be enough though. At this rate, it is like we are only scooping water of out of a filling bathtub, but not focusing on the actual problem and source itself in climate change. 
<br><br>
This issue is also highlighted by Santa Barbara's issue of being worried more about how they look and their appearance than actually talking the walk. So often are we talked about about being enviornmentally concsious, only to continue to allow the huge oil rigs in our waters and keeping the same carbon emission levels. It will not change anytime soon. This city thrives on tourism, with the promise of a riviera paradise, so the city and county will continue current consumption and plans. They are doing more today, but not saving tomorrow.
<br><hr>

I agree with your take on the deceivingly beautiful landscape of Santa Barbara. I think that students and residents find ourselves too comfortable living in such a stunning place with generally temperate if not perfect weather all year. Because of this, we are blinded to the fact that our area’s temperature is rising at one of the most rapid rates in the country. Santa Barbara is considered to be a generally progressive area; however, most residents are only willing to make changes that are easy and free. This mindset is entirely too apathetic. With a radical problem, it is necessary that there be radical solutions. 

<br><br>

While I was reading the article, I related to the quote by Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams: “Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote.” For as long as I have known about the climate crisis, it has been daunting, but never tangible. It is entirely new and terrifying to read about the clear effects of climate change that are already occurring and directly affecting my life.

<br><hr>
I agree with the point you made about being surprised and disappointed that Santa Barbara has not been as green and eco-friendly as it has always appeared to be. Considering that Santa Barbara is the literal birthplace of Earth Day, you would think that the city and its elected officials would put more of an emphasis on being environmentally friendly and take the issue of climate change more seriously. Although the Thomas Fire and other climate fueled incidents may have sparked a conversation about climate change and renewable energy, the city of Santa Barbara should be doing the most to switch to an eco-conscious agenda not only for the health of the environment but for the wellbeing and safety of Santa Barbara Country residents as well. 
<br><br>
The last statement of your response was the most relatable to me because I too fear that one day I may not be able to show my children and grandchildren the places and things I once loved, not only UCSB per say but every other place and being that could be destroyed by the devastation of climate change. If my kids or grandkids never get to live at the same time as a whale or polar bear or koala I will be so torn apart. It is, as you said, truly heartbreaking.
<br><hr>
Your first paragraph on the idealized haven of Santa Barbara was very thought-provoking for me. Moving here from out of state, I had many environmental assumptions I had never really checked. Coming from the south, I took my bias of all Californians being vegan and hating plastic water bottles to mean that the community I would move into was going to be highly environmentally conscious. Yet, now I learn about the lack of action in many areas and I realize that everywhere has so much work to do, even the places that have a facade of sustainability.
<br><br>


 I also found myself struck by the quote "Santa Barbara is often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives" as I feel guilty of it myself. How many pictures have we all posted in front of the cliffs of DP or the beautiful beach sunsets while ignoring that these picturesque landmarks are fleeting as we know it? The laid back culture on this campus is to be celebrated, but I also think it needs to be countered with more urgency to protect this place we call home. I have only lived here for a little over one quarter and I have already seen an encroaching fire and a home lost to the cliffs. I really agree with what you said about our need for radical solutions and immediate action as the effects can be seen and will worsen every quarter I am here.

<br><hr>
I was also devastated to hear that Santa Barbara has increased 2.3 degrees in temperature in the past few years. We had the biggest increase in temperature, second only to Ventura. Both Santa Barbara and Ventura are known for being nice beach cities, but clearly aren't worried about their environmental changes. If these two cities continue to increase in temperature at the same rate, they are both going to experience catastrophic events including natural disasters. In order to preserve our California coastal cities we need to make changes to the way we live and limit the CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. The quote you stated by Scott Wilson is very true, as it seems that the older generations are more worried about the way everything looks and not the climate crisis itself. Whether people believe in the climate crisis or not, it is a real issue that needs to be addressed and everyone should be concerned about the issue, especially those of us who live in Santa Barbara and Ventura.
<br><hr>
I agree with the points you have made, especially since Santa Barbara is home to all of us. A home that I have always thought was fighting back on the climate crisis; it was devastating to read that Santa Barbara county "pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% compared with 2007 levels. Two years later...rather than reducing emissions, Santa Barbara was actually exceeding its 2007 levels by 14%." It's ironic how Santa Barbara is the birthplace of Earth Day, yet we aren't fighting the climate crisis the way we're suppose to be. On UCSB campus I constantly see signs like "save the earth" and we have implemented the new flushing method and signs in the communal bathroom of "how to take a 5 minute shower," but the county isn't doing their part. 
<br><br>
I still have another 3 years here in Santa Barbara, and I'm terrified to see what natural disasters this county is going to face with the path we are taking. My first two months, I had already seen a fire from my dorm room; what's to come in the next couple of months? Will I even have the opportunity to live in IV? I was so excited to live and study in "paradise" but now it's a scary future.
<br><hr>
What you quoted from Scott Wilson inspired me. People really do not care about how it lives as much as caring how it looks like. There are still students/staff members in our school who have experienced the Thomas fire back in 2017. I am sure it was a tough period of time for everyone who was in Santa Babara area. After the fire, there were people saying how terrible the fire was, how the air was, how there were burning ashes everywhere, and there were even Youtube videos titled like “how I survived in Thomas fire”... I am not blaming that they should not film the fire or they should not use the fire as a hook of the video. I feel like within this film, not only the video maker/YouTuber but also the viewer, which are us, need to think about why there was this catastrophic disaster happening around us. In the article, Santa Barbara is the city that ranks second place in the annual temperature change from 1895-2018. I hope that with the little power we have I hope that even with the little power we have, Santa Barbara will not be any worse. Hopefully, we will be able to have a better environment/less climate crisis/less natural disasters in the future.
<br><hr>
I have the same feeling about Santa Barbara as you did. Being an international student, I had dozens of universities to choose from. I chose UCSB for the mild climate and the incredible landscape. But now I realize that my beloved college might not be here when I die. Sea level rise is coming, and it is coming fast. I cannot believe that so many houses on del Playa drive are under danger. I mean, it is such an icon of IV, I hate to see it erode into the pacific. 
<br><br>

In fact, according to my Geography professor, 50 percent of our campus will be underwater if the artic completely melts away. If the south pole melts, we will not have our city anymore. Looking at the pictures on his slides, I was petrified. 
<br><br>

I believe we can all work towards a better future. It takes time and effort to unchange climate change, we just have to have faith.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, it really is frustrating to live in a place that only cares about how it looks to others. Seems like not much can be done to save this place but patiently wait until this county collapses, unless some rich guy pays a politician to make things right. I wasn't at this school when there was a drought, yet I can still imagine those terrible hot days that people must have endured, especially to those that went to a class without the air conditioner working. The only thing getting people through the week were the parties at DP, however it sucks to think that in 40 years DP might not even exist. I feel that we the younger generation is in charge of what becomes famous and important in the media so we still might have a fighting chance. Lets just hope that Santa Barbara gets its shit together.

<br><hr>
I agree with your entire take on the whole Santa Barbara persona. Looking at newer buildings across UCSB, I've noticed that many of them have been LEED certified. This is great and all but it is merely a small image of what the city of Santa Barbara needs to do as a whole. It is clear that from the increase in temperatures to the area being one of the greatest in the country, that we are not doing merely enough. Santa Barbara is referred to as a "weekend vacation" for LA locals and its beautiful climate and beaches attract many. This, however, is merely a fake image of what truly underlies in our cities infrastructure. On the surface, people like myself, see Santa Barbara as the perfect resort destination, all the while not knowing that the climate in this area is rapidly increasing and the city itself is failing in doing its part. Growing up in a small city near LA, I would never hear any stories/articles of my cities emissions and goals to prevent climate increase. Now living in SB, many of these events hit closer to home and I feel a deeper sense of frustration and worry. Simply hearing that nearby avocado farms now must overhaul their entire infrastructure of growing avocados for past generations now must revert to planting agave is a huge warning sign. If we do not change our ways, our current way of living will be no more. DP will fail to exist in the near future, SB's mediterranean climate will simply warm up, farmers must change many of their crops, and many other dangers will follow. Santa Barbara/Ventura County specifically must hold themselves accountable for their goals set to ensure that we can continue enjoying these natural luxuries that make our community extremely unique before they become a thing of the past.

Man, what's sickening to me Katelyn is that we are literally living in the climate crisis NOW. Like legit our government and media just don't care because it's not materially beneficial to them. I'll never forget biking to the gym the night of those fires around thanksgiving and just looking at that hellish landscape in front of me. I had always heard stories of the Thomas fires but never could I imagine the loss of life I was literally witnessing in front of my eyes; on top of that, this recent fire was still relatively small considering what California has been facing in the last 10 years. Based on the findings in the article, not only are the effects of climate change getting more drastic, but the speed at which they are occurring has become exponential. 
<br><br>
While it's easy to get scared and sad about this rapid (and quite amazing imo) change in the climate, I think it's beautiful at the resilience and determination thats being shown by these farmers here in SoCal.To me, it shows the importance of realizing that, hey we are currently screwed and crying about it isn't going to help. The best thing we can do adapt how we think and approach the problem. Like how these farmers have switched their strategies as a means for survival and prosperity, I have faith in the human race to be able to come together (eventually) to do the right thing.
<br><hr>
I definitely feel your worry and concern. I had no idea how close the climate crisis hit home. Growing up in Southern California, I did see some issues first hand such as ocean pollution and air pollution. However, I didn't even know really about the Thomas fires before coming here or how the climate crisis impacted UCSB specifically. I do wonder what would happen to this campus even in a century if it will be completely destroyed due to climate change or if the world made changes and prevented the destruction. One thing that made me fall in love with this campus was the beautiful oceans, clean campus, and that most people used bikes as transportation. Honestly, the campus seems very eco-friendly. However, that is sadly not enough to stop the destruction on the homes on DelPlaya and not enough to stop natural disasters from occurring. 
<br><br>

I think what shocked me the most was the tornado warning that Chuck had mentioned. A tornado warning in California is almost unheard of and is almost like having snow in Los Angeles. However, with the rate of climate change, crazier weather is not going to be surprising anymore. More and more fires, mudslides, and rising sea levels will happen. I also agree that the media should cover it significantly more than it currently is. However, I do have hope that there is a change that will occur, especially with how much the media covered the Australian fires. Hopefully our second home isn’t destroyed and we can change our ways.

<br><hr>
I’m 21 years old and have been visiting the Santa Barbara area regularly with my parents, both of whom are UCSB alumni, since I was 6 years old. I have visited at all times of the year for extensive periods of time, and have parents who lived in the area for about 5-6 years. All of this is to say that my family and I have had the unique experience of personally watching this area change with the climate in the last few decades. 

<br><br>

My parents used to tell me stories about wet, foggy Santa Barbara winters; winters with enough rain to warrant them bringing a towel in their backpacks to class to dry off every day, or wearing a rain poncho half the week trying to stay dry walking around campus. The annual “June gloom” they spoke of now extends from May into August. It’s January, and it has rained only twice since the academic year started in September. Another moment struck me last month that really made me reflect on the climate change here in our local area. There was a high of 80 degrees on my birthday in December this year. I spent it in a tank top at the beach with my friends. You would’ve thought it was the middle of August if you hadn’t known the date. We spent several days in December at the beach; a beach that was nearly twice as wide when my parents were here 30 years ago. The houses on DP weren’t in immediate danger of falling into the ocean like they are now. My children (if I even choose to have them given the state of the world they’d be born into) will not be able to listen to my stories and live them out for themselves the way I was able to do with my parents. By the time they are old enough to attend UCSB, should it remain,  DP will be largely condemned.
<br><br>


So you can imagine the horrible confused and dumbstruck looks on my parent’s faces when I backed up my claims about the obvious changes in the Santa Barbara climate with this article. The maps showing the 2.3 degree warming in the county left them speechless. Largely, they have denied climate change is caused primarily by humans as have many others in their generation. It took it finally hitting them where it hurts, and hard, to really think about the impact we’re actually having, and I think this speaks to what it’s going to take to create a non generational consensus on this issue.

<br><hr>

Santa Barbara to me has always seemed like one of the most environmentally involved places until I moved to its general area. It seems very hypocritical of the city to be presented in a way that it is not. As a student here, it is hard to believe that not everyone will experience the beauty of Santa Barbara the way most students have. Here we have a culture that is very involved in the Del Playa street and to know that in the future, it might just not be there is mind boggling. This place and the bordering cities near by are in danger and that will affect many cultures and families. Especially students who rely on places like the beach to relieve stress and rely on the city of Isla Vista in general to find housing. Based on the information given by the article, it leads us to believe the school itself had the possibility to be harmed. 
<br><br>


It is just crazy to think off this place many students call home as something that is in danger. Even the bordering city of Ventura with its elevated temperature has the potential to go through a lot. Some things have to change and the sooner we act, the better we make things for the oncoming future generations.
<br><hr>
Your last sentence just gets me. Now I’m probably feeling the same kind of emotion that you were experiencing while reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit” by Scott Wilson. I just moved to UCSB last summer as an international student and freshman. The landscape, the ocean view, the coastline, and the nice weather here…everything has been stunning to me. However, I never thought that our county, Santa Barbara, is in an urgent situation, in which it suffered from the wildfires and floods caused by global warming. Related to the documentary Fire in Paradise, I’ve seen the destructive power of a wildfire. Even more closely, last November, Cave fire just attacked and spread out to our school’s backyard, which was just at the hill behind my dorm, Santa Catalina. There was a moment when I felt like that was in hell while the flaming light was all around. After taking English 23, I could really relate that cave fire to our climate change and it’s an emergency for us to address our climate crisis otherwise living areas for human-beings might be cur short day by day. It’s not just the wildfire, and hundreds and thousands of both terrestrial and marine animal species are experiencing such a tragedy brought out by the climate change. We must take action. It’s Now or Never.

<br><hr>
I was also pretty surprised by the quote "Santa Barbara is often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives." I had previously thought that Santa Barbara was considered a place that is taking a lot of action in the climate and environmental crisis. It is unfortunate that this is just a front that Santa Barbara puts up. Reading about the eroding cliffs on Del Playa Drive and your point that we might not be able to show our grandchildren the college that we went to was very heartbreaking. 

<br><br>

It was also pretty scary to learn that a quarter of, or 40 million, California residents live in high-risk fire zones. This is an extremely significant number of people. The fact that three of the worst wildfires in California have occurred in the past two years really conveys how the issues with fires are worsening along with the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I agree with the disappointment you feel in what feels like the lack of care and action the city of Santa Barbara is taking in trying to counter/prevent the negative effects of climate change. With our city's temperature rising now over 2 degrees celsius it is no wonder we are being hit with the harsh consequences of nearby wildfires and even unpredictable storms like the recent tornado warnings. This article really opened my eyes to the realities of these problems and how even when they are this close too home, action is not being taken. As you mentioned it is absolutely heartbreaking that the future of our beautiful little college town is now in threat of being destroyed by our own doings. The effects of climate change are here and it is our responsibility to now take action and prevent/limit its effects while we can
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your point of view here. This is my first year living in Santa Barbara, and as much as I love the city's Mediterranean scenery, it's true when you quoted "Santa Barbara is often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives". In the reading, there's a graph indicating the temperature rise in areas of California over a long time. I wasn't surprised that LA is so outstanding in that graph since it's one of the biggest metropolitans in the world, but I was shocked that Ventura as well as Santa Barbara are indicated by the same purple color in that graph, meaning our temperature is rising as fast as LA. This is our own backyard, but we failed to protect it. Last year we all saw the cave fire that was clearly visible from our campus, which is so unforgettable as one of my first experiences in South California. Indeed, as mentioned in the reading, SB is sometimes considered a peaceful place to spend the weekend for those wealthy LA residents, and that's why we care about what we look. However, changing the way we live is necessary at this point, because here we are, with a 2.3 degree Celsius rise in average temperature compared to 1895--absolutely beyond the limit.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your sentiments. It is so shocking to me that these fires that have been occurring at our school- in our own backyard- are doing so much damage and that is a result of the climate criss that we face. My dad attended UCSB and now, as his daughter 30 years later, I am attending his alma mater. It would be so nice for me to be able to show my own children the school that I attended three generations later. However, that will not be possible due to all the drought and wildfire threats that we face and that is such a scary thing to think about. In addition, the quote "SB is often accused of caring more about how it looks that how it lives" could not be more accurate. Our city is doing little to actually fight the climate crisis and is instead more focused on advertising its beauty and the fact that the beach is on our doorstep to the general public. I personally would like to be able to do more for this beautiful city that I now call home and I hope that people around me, students and teachers alike, would be more inclined to do so as well. The statement that the article made that "Scientists have no clear answer for why this region is heating up so fast. But they say a century of urbanization in Los Angeles and Orange counties probably plays a role, bringing more traffic up and down the region’s single north-south coastal highway." is a sad but truthful fact that we have to face. The temperature here is gradually heating up and it will continue to do so to due several factors, one of them being all the emissions from the cars. Fossil fuels and gas emissions are going to continue to affect us until we all work together to lessen the emissions and somehow reverse the damages that have been affecting our world for years.
<br><hr>
I think attributing the term ‘crisis’ to describe what we’re currently facing with climate change is appropriate. It is important that we finally take action and not only steps that make us feel comfortable but those that have immediate effects. 
<br><br>
The fires will only continue to grow in frequency and magnify in its destruction, something that serves as a direct threat to us and we still remain indifferent towards this crisis.

<p>
I believe that Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams said it best said it best when he stated that, "Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote." Santa Barbara is stated as a well informed county regarding the environment I believe UCSB especially consists of students aware of the situation but do not know the extent of how climate change can directly affect them. It shocked me to discover how the pledge to cut emissions by 14% resulted in an increase by 14% and hope the fact that climate will actually affect them cause people to start taking more action.

I feel the same way as Ken did when I read the "Global weirding" part of the article. In the Wallace article, we got to know all sorts of consequences that can be caused by climate change. However, as the climate changes in such a short time, there might also be unpredictable consequences. They might happen in a lighting fast speed or become so extreme that we don't even have the time or knowledge to come up with plans to deal with it. It's horrifying to just think about that. Also as Ken said, those consequences may not only be limited to the climate level but would bring different levels of ramifications as well. The article talks about how, because of the drought, farmers have to change what they grow and sell. I have never thought about that before until I read this article. But in the future, we might be forced to change our diet, even if we don't want to, because the climate won't allow those food to be produced anymore. It can even change our lifestyles profoundly, as it already starts to happen. Once those resorts and houses and apartments were beautifully built by seashores were now threatened, and people have to move elsewhere. 
<br><br>


Ironically, I realize we rely on nature for so many things, not just being in it and enjoying the view of it, but also growing certain fruits and vegetables. However, when those human-caused disasters happen—drought and wildfires—we have to rely on nature again, to wait it rains, to save us. When someone makes mistakes over and over again, and what this person does is becoming harmful to you, you are not going to be nice to this one anymore. It's sad to hear after all these things happened to Santa Barbara, the local government is still considering expanding drilling operations relentlessly and recklessly and keeping exploiting nature. The punishment will be severer if this doesn't stop.

Global warming is always a universal issue that need to be faced and fixed on time. Also, I have never realized how close these kinds of issues happened. I still remember last year several fires happened in Santa Barbara. Most of students including me did not think it was related to global warming problem. After those fire, the sky was dark and fulled of smog just like they were crying. However, due to the large profit, most companies prefer to focus on what they can earn instead of what they will bring to the whole environment. Even though American government has signed contract to ensure the emission  of carbon dioxide, but the truth is a challenge that the outcomes have already exceeded the origin goal. In this way, i think it still needs a long way to go.

The article, "2°C: Beyond the limit," felt a lot more personal than the other readings that I've had for not only this class, but also in English 22 because it addresses the area in which I have come to see as my home in recent years. The more time I spend here, the more I learn about the area and the more it worms its way into my heart. Santa Barbara has had a very intimate history with the environment, exemplified by the events of the Thomas Fire and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. Even the recent Cave Fire and coastal storm warnings showed that as the climate crisis continues to worsen, SB will continue to be majorly affected. The question in the reading that interested me the most was "If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?" In today's political climate, it is very fortunate to live in an area that heavily supports climate change activism. Even so, it is telling that even with severe events and local disaster, it is extremely hard to change the normalized lifestyle we have today to one that will truly help slow down or stop the current crisis. Even though I have lived in Southern California my entire life, I've seen it too many times in my own personal life. No matter how much evidence is stacked up against them, they only are truly willing to consider adaptation when it personally affects them. They and myself may have been fortunate enough to avoid the catastrophes so far, but there is no telling when the next inevitable disaster will strike, especially as events, like the Paradise and Thomas Fires, turn to commonplace within our backyard.

I think people like to shrug off the issues of climate change. They think “today was supposed to be sunny and now it's raining, so climate change must not be real.” Often times people neglect to acknowledge climate change’s existence until it affects them personally. Before reading this article, I had no idea that Santa Barbara was so greatly impacted by climate change. If you were to ask me what city in California has had the largest change in temperature over the past few centuries, I can promise you my answer never would’ve been Ventura. I most likely would’ve said the Central Valley, where drought and high temperatures are a threat. 
<br><br>

...Well to be honest, everywhere is now threatened by drought and high temperatures. I’m not from Southern California, but I always enjoyed visiting. I moved down here four months ago, not knowing the scary state this region is in. SoCal being so dry and windy has led to intense fires, deadly mudslides, and extreme drought. On a more personal level, Wilson mentions that along Del Playa, a street every UCSB student knows, the cliffs of SB are disappearing due to ocean level rising. Climate change hits different when you’re experiencing and seeing it with your own eyes. 
<br><br>

Something that stood out to me from this article was Scott Wilson’s claim that changes in the natural world cause social reckoning. This is interesting to think about. A fire can destroy a neighborhood, leaving casualties. A hurricane can wipe out a city, leaving people homeless. These are just a couple of examples of the social horrors that come with natural disasters. The sad thing is, these disasters are becoming more and more common as climate change continues.





</p><hr>


<p>

In the article Scott Wilson explains to the audience the ongoing climate change dangers occurring right in our backyards of Santa Barbara. It starts off by mentioning that  over the past few years natural disasters here have been happening more frequently. A Camping resort manager states how before 2016 nothing happened but ever since then they have just gotten “used to it”. Since 2016 two huge fires have occurred and a huge storm as well. Such events here were uncommon up until recently. The storms and fires are proof that climate change is not something waiting for us in the future but is here in the present. We are living the effects of climate change today. And it shouldn’t be something we just have to get “used to”. Instead we should act upon it and start change now. The article states how Santa Barbara has a legacy of how progressive it is on its environmental movements yet it is failing to meet its own anti pollution goals. Climate change should be a top priority everywhere especially in a place where the beginning effects of climate change are already having such a huge impact. Time is running out and sooner than later it will be too late to take action.

<p>
Having lived in SoCal my entire life, I found this article particularly interesting and relevant to me. I live in a city where directly north of us are the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Multiple times in my life I remember them catching on fire, our city being smokey, school getting canceled, and houses getting evacuated. For months and months after, we lived with sandbags on the corners of every street in case a big post-fire rain started a flood. This is what I was used to, and thought was just the norm of living in a city right by mountains. Not until this article did I realize that this is due to the climate crisis. Hearing that in my hometown, the heat rise has already passed the 2 degree limit, hit me the most.
<br><br>

It also really shocked me hearing how responsible Santa Barbara is for greenhouse gas emissions. I knew that a lot of climate change activism has rooted from here, but did not realize how little effect it has had on the town's behaviors. The actions from Santa Barbara do not compare to the talk and promises given, which is disappointing. I really thought our school was in a place with less hypocrisy and more action. The entire county of people cannot be blamed; although there is no one enforcing the regulations, I know there are many people and places trying to bring change in the area. It is a strawless city, with lots of compostable packaging, and UCSB dining halls that incorporate Meatless Mondays. These little steps will hopefully add up to a larger movement, which will hopefully help with the issues ranging from parking to the destroyed cliffs.
<br><br>

Overall, this article really opened my eyes to how much climate change affects both my “home home” and my “school home”. I had no idea that my backyard in both places are basically being slowly destroyed by this crisis, and I think more people need to be aware of that.

Living in Southern California all my life, I also share a similar experience. One of my first distinctive memories of being in my house is of one of the many times my family had to evacuate from a fire. My parents packed up everything important and took pictures of all the rooms in our house to remember the house and everything that we couldn't bring with us. Even though I was so young, I remember that this was a very depressing occurrence. Right before we left to go to my grandmother's house, I remember standing in my parent's bedroom looking out toward our backyard. There are no neighbors to the back of me. All that lies behind my house is the chaparral of an LA County Green Space. I remember being able to see the fire in the distance quickly burning toward my house. My neighbor, who stayed through the fire, reported to us when we got back that the fire actually bounced off our house (the houses in my neighborhood were all built in 2000 and were designed to be "fire-proof"). I thought this was a normal occurrence. I've had to evacuate my home numerous times because of fires. It wasn't until reading this article that I realized these things aren't normal. 
<br><br>

Even though disaster is literally striking in our backyards, I'm very frustrated to find out that my home is only environmentally friendly in appearances. Paying for parking seems like a small price to pay for protecting the earth, yet people won't do it. Los Angeles, the home of kale-eating, metal straw sipping people pretend to be eco-friendly yet still drive everywhere. I even know people who drive a couple houses up to see a friend because they're too lazy to walk. It is absolute hypocrisy that in the Santa Barbara Public Market, most of the restaurants switched to paper straws (which I'm now convinced was down for appearances only) yet there is a pure-meat barbecue restaurant and the meat dishes are one of the most popular items on every menu. 
<br><br>

I've always prided myself of living in such an eco-friendly part of the world. Because of that, this article's main point wasn't showing the extreme disaster SB and Ventura is already facing due to the climate crisis, but was to show how extremely shameful we should all be because we're doing close to nothing about it.

The article “2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT” is definitely an alarming piece for someone who is currently residing in the state of California. As the article mentioned, we tend to see Climate change as something that is happening, but fairly remote. And as a fact: it is not. Disasters are happening right in our backyard, and people are paying their lives for it. From agricultural loss to destruction of households, this piece has definitely educated me well with the multiple aspects of the consequences of Climate change. One of the biggest shockers for me is the soil erosion right next to DP. No matter what time of the day, DP always has the golden views. I can’t imagine the seashore erosion crawling in and eat away the scenic route. It might not happen during our academic years, but I don’t want it to become a history of UCSB for decades and decades later because of climate change. 
<br><br>

Meanwhile, I believe the tornado warning around last Christmas serves as a timely warming for all people around Santa Barbara area. As a student coming from Georgia, where a week without rainfall are rare instances, it was quite a shocker for me that it did not rain a single drop of rain for straight up 2 months since I touched down here, and of course tornadoes are something way off my imagination. But the tornado warning once again ringed to alarm. Climate change is threatening our homeland through various means and there had been countless times that we had lost not only our properties, but also our loved ones to it. I hope ones around us would take it well and start acting accordingly.

I agree with you on your statement with the fact that climate change is happening right around us, especially in DP. The erosion that led to rocks falling off DP is certainly very scary and worrisome. It is only a matter of time for similar events to happen around us. As a person who has never experienced any natural catastrophes, any type of alert would trouble me, not to say a tornado that might come. Whether we like is or not, we are rapidly being affected by climate change and I do agree with you that we should start acting immediately and accordingly.

“2ºC: Beyond the Limit" took on a very personal perspective for me. A perspective that rationalized the climate crisis for me. Everyone knows Del Playa to be the life of Isla Vista. The gist of many UCSB student's first tastes of the social scene at college. By 2060 Del Playa will be nothing of that sort. It won't be an example of the party scene at UCSB but rather it will be an example of the climate crisis. What so many people covet for in terms of housing will no longer exist. This is just on a very small scale. What so many people covet for in terms of everything will no longer exist by 2060 at this current rate. The fact that over 40 million Californian residents live in high-risk fire zones terrifies me. This fear stems from the fact that in moving to the US only two years back, I have already witnessed two large-scale wildfires. 
<br><br>

Now prior to this reading I wasn't fully aware of the backbone of these fires. Through the reading, I came to know that Santa Barbara has risen by over 2.3 degrees Celcius. This came to be a huge surprise to me as I thought Santa Barbara was a very beautiful and peaceful retirement city. It then occurred to me that Earth Day was initiated here in Santa Barbara. How can be accountable to such an important movement when yet Santa Barbara is more guilty than most! It also occurred to me that Santa Barbara has a large elderly population. With a population largely that is largely composed of the elderly I came to be quite flustered. The people who instigated the climate crisis are many of that generation and the fact that they are continuing to contribute to the climate crisis overtly really angers me. However, I shouldn't be so fixated on the little things and rather think big picture. Rather than playing the blame game in which I was doing in the aforestated sentence, we need to come to a consensus that change needs to occur. It needs to occur before we get to the "too little too late" phase. It needs to occur now.

Before reading this article (and last week's of course), I believed that climate change was real but I didn't truly understand what kind of effects it would have on my reality. When I decided on moving to Santa Barbara for college, I had heard that Santa Barbara was a high-risk fire zone but since it had become so normal I didn't worry too much. After reading this article though and hearing about the effects of the Thomas Fire and the rising sea level slowly eroding the hills of Del Playa -- it really did hit me. Similar to you, and all other UCSB students, DP is such an important part of my UCSB experience. While I'm not much of a partier, DP is where I had my first "wow, I am so lucky to go here" moment on campus. Like you said, DP is not only an essential part of the community -- it houses a large amount of students. It is so sad to hear that by 2060, it will no longer be what it is today. Perhaps the most saddening fact of all though is that this is only a small proportion of what will happen in the future, and what is already happening in other places. I understand now that the climate crisis isn't a matter of what is "going to happen", it is what is happening right now and what we are doing about it. It is crazy to learn that Santa Barbara is the home to Earth day and the birth of the modern environmental movement, considering how little the county is doing about the issue. I could not relate more to what you said about the high elderly population here. It is SO frustrating to me to live in one of the most "environmentally conscious cities" and states for that matter, yet to have no changes on our part. I believe that our generation is waking up, and its due in part to classes like this one and social media who are informing us about environmental issues. But based on what Santa Barbara county has been doing, I don't think we are nearly where we need to be yet. The most upsetting thing is that we have no choice but to act now, and we aren't.


<br><hr>
Something really I find really interesting is how people's attitudes towards the fire season vary based off of where they are from. Californians (including myself) have really grown to view fires so casually; the frequency at which they occur is so regular that I find myself feeling like smaller fires aren't particularly noteworthy. I'm from San Diego and it isn't uncommon for people to have experienced their houses burning down or being damaged by wildfires. I always forget that this isn't a natural occurrence and shouldn't be normalized and often have to be reminded by people like you who aren't from California. 
<br><br>

A lot of Californians consider themselves environmentally friendly, but generally are not an exception to the rule that people will value their own economic benefit over environmental well-being. The example in the article about free parking politics in Santa Barbara was surprising to me because I know SB is a pretty wealthy community; people who value the environment should be willing to shell out a couple extra dollars or take the bus downtown if they care so much, but refuse to. I know I hate paying for parking, but when looking at it from a perspective of environmental degradation, I would personally be willing to pay or take the bus more often in order to reduce emissions and preserve the beautiful community we live in.
<br><hr>
I agree with mostly everything that you said but frankly I think we should keep having the "blame game" conversation. How is that fossil fuel companies and those in power who put us in the situation that we are right now get off the hook for everything they've done? There is absolutely no accountability when there very well should be. They have and continue to exacerbate the situation KNOWINGLY and face no consequences, so in that regard we really should keep playing the "blame game." 

<br><br>

It's interesting to learn about erosion in IV because I always think of the impacts of the climate crisis in the context of the region I'm from (the Inland Empire) with the logistics industry and diesel/smog pollution causing extremely poor air quality. But I think I often get tunnel vision and should pay more attention how the climate crisis impacts other places--like our school. I think it's sad to think that in a couple of decades dp, which is such a prominent aspect of social life at ucsb, won't exist anymore. I can't really wrap my head around that.
<br><hr>
I was also shocked to know that Santa Barbara’s average temperature has risen over 2.3 degrees Celsius. The first and most important reason I choose to come to UCSB is because of the beautiful environment and stable weather in the city of Santa Barbara. But as time progresses, I realized this place isn’t so stable as I thought. Summer mornings began to be too hot, when you stand underneath the sunlight, my skin literally feels like burning. The same for winter, nights can get so cold that I would be shivering so much as I walk from my classes to the bus station. Extreme temperature difference is what I truly felt about climate change is happening in this beautiful place. 
<br><br>

I made changes to my lifestyle quite some time ago. Choosing bus instead of calling Uber or Lyft, reducing the amount of meat in my diet, controlling the amount of water I am using daily. I would not say I am making a significant impact, but if many others come to the same sense, and actions are taken now, we still have hope for the future.
<br><hr>
I concur in the weird, dissonant feeling that the place we all call home probably wont look much like it does now, even 20 years from now. The first time my Dad visited UCSB, one of the comments he made and continues to make is about how our campus hangs off a cliff and is being eroded away. Our beaches are over time becoming smaller, the cliffs are eroding, and we are seeing repeated fires close to campus, so the conclusions drawn in the Washington Post article should be hitting us personally. Some of the things we love so much about our campus are being so heavily damaged, which should be a motivator for us to want to learn more and take action.
<br><hr>
I find it so crazy that we sort of just shrug off these things that are happening around us that are obvious consequences of climate change. We act like oh its no big deal it's another fire that happens all the time. There was a fire this past thanksgiving break that I completely forgot about until reading this comment trying to figure out what the second fire would be. I heard someone's deck collapsed on Del Playa and sort of laughed it off and moved on not really thinking any more of it. All these things happen around us, but I feel like we don't understand the true danger that they cause. We often think the consequences of climate change are so far away with things like sea-level rise, but we ignore the consequences happening right around us right now. It is sad that it takes me having to read an article to realize these things are not normal and should not just be shrugged off, and I need to realize the true effects we are creating with the way we are living. It creates this sense of "its now or never" with fear of the scale of these problems. I want future generations to enjoy the beauty that brought me to this school and how special it is.

“We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” - 2ºC: Beyond the limit
<br><br>


Not to bring my comment back to Before the Flood when it’s supposed to be about the reading- but there is a personal connection that I’ve linked between the two and wanted to share. The above quote is one that hit me really hard from the 2ºC: Beyond the Limit reading. It hit especially hard though after a conversation I had with my dad, a venture capitalist who owns his own investment firm. After watching Before the Flood I recommended it to him, in addition to suggesting that maybe he start looking to invest in some clean energy tech start-ups, or start his search for more environmentally progressive companies to invest in. This was his response: 
<br><br>


“Ok - that documentary is sobering and scary.  Really makes one think about consumption, etc. (and that was made 3 years ago).  Other than a few company headlines about going Carbon neutral, hard to see what progress if any has been made.  Can apply that to myself as one of the offending baby boomers as well.  Thanks for the recommendation!”
<br><br>


And as great as that is that he learned from the film, here is the kicker from his response that ties back into the above quote: 

<br><br>

“Unfortunately, those environmental investments are really capital intensive and a lot of the big investments have been burned (pardon the pun).”

<br><br>

Ignoring the dad joke that he couldn’t resist, my dad as a business owner is a prime example of how the hypocrisy Santa Barbara is facing in its environmental plight develops in the first place. He was able to admit to being fearful of what’s to come in the near future with climate change, yet the “capital intensive” nature of progressive and effective action against climate change is too much of a burden for his business to bear. This unfortunately is the case for most businesses and is the reason Santa Barbara, unbeknownst to me before reading this article, has been struggling in reducing CO2 emissions and being more environmentally effective instead of just environmentally conscious. 
<br><br>


I really learned a lot from this article regarding Santa Barbara that I didn’t know before. In my dad’s words, it was very “sobering” and I hope that soon some real changes can be made. And just so everyone knows, I promise I will not give up on trying to get my boomer dad to get a little more environmentally active.

This quote also really stuck out to me because it is so indicative of the stance of the United States as a whole on climate change. It’s interesting that you connected this with Before the Flood because it made me think about the scene when DiCaprio is talking to Sunita Narain and she calls him and the US out for the hypocrisy of wanting India to not use the coal that they need to use to give power to millions of people. DiCaprio wants the US to be a leader in this fight, but Narain points out that we have not transitioned to solar and cannot expect others to without setting an example first. 
<br><br>

Similarly, this article highlights that Santa Barbara’s representation as a leading county in moving towards renewable energy and sustainability is largely based on image, not action. My friends and I often go out onto the bluffs to watch the sunset here in Isla Vista, and every time the beautiful horizon is partially tainted by the oil rig. If my research is correct, then I do not believe this rig is still in use, but it stands as a constant reminder for the pollution that industries cause to make money. The article mentions that the oil industry continues to overpower climate activism and that new oil projects are being proposed, including “major drilling expansion in the north”.
<br><br>

Political leaders in Santa Barbara and the US as a whole are not doing what they need to do to prevent further rise in temperatures, so this article points out that it is the citizens having to make the changes. Farm owner, Jay Ruskey, had to switch from mainly growing avocados to exotic fruits due to how water intensive avocado growing is. Changes in climate completely alter agriculture, and as Ken mentions, California is a leader in agriculture, so this will alter food security. Larry Saarloos has had to equip his ranch with many new fire safety measures, spending his own money. Farmers like Saarloos have asked if they will be reimbursed for lost produce and their questions remain unanswered.
<br><br>

After all these direct effects of climate change are devastating Santa Barbara, it is very concerning that little change is truly happening.

This article was an eye-opener to those who live in Santa Barbara now, including myself. The general notion of climate change affecting areas far away from where we call home is quickly disproven in the article “2°C Beyond the Limit.” Recent changes in weather patterns, especially in California, are showing how this issue that seemed like a distant theory is now our frightening reality. As scary as droughts, fires, temperature rises, and mudslides seem, it is unfortunate to see little to no action takes place, as we continue to fail to see the clear link between climate change and the endangerment of our own homes (there are exceptions to this, as shown in the article that people are getting together and trying to devise a plan for the safety of the community). This reminded me of when California was in a major drought for roughly the past decade, but the average person just went along their daily life without any major lifestyle shifts. I really hope that more articles like this come out and start a call for action, rather than causing an initial shock to the reader followed by them forgetting once they close the laptop.

"2°C: Beyond the limit" was very informative on the effects of climate change in Santa Barbara. I had assumed that Santa Barbara was pretty good at climate change policy and preparation but the article said otherwise. It was also scary to know that Ventura county is the fastest warming county and that this is all happening in our own backyards. I feel that most people think of climate change as not an immediate threat to them but the facts are that the effects of climate change effect us right now. Being students at UCSB, we face many effects of climate change, living near the coast as it erodes and the dryer weather and the fires that are caused from it.

     I also believed that Santa Barbara was very considerate of the environment in their climate change policies because of the environmental conflicts that it had already endured such as the Oil spill that occurred here in 1969. This article was certainly a surprise because it showed that our local community of Santa Barbara was just as self-centered and economically driven as the rest of the world.
 <br><br>
It helps the reader see how the policies of the area are driven by politics rather than what is best for society as a whole.
<br><br>
Another part of your comment that I also agree with is the immediacy and urgency of the climate crisis due to our proximity to Ventura County. I agree that Climate Change is a lot more impactful when we are very close to the actual consequences. While we may not have encountered the consequences of climate change yet, that does not mean that we will not soon. 
<br><br>
As the readings have demonstrated, Climate change can cause many extraordinary and destructive effects in hours. The article specifically references the mudslides in Montecito while the documentary this week focused on the Camp Fire in Paradise. I bring these examples up to contextualize our surroundings and the consequences that we potentially face. The article talks about the instability of the cliffs on Del Playa. It is very scary to think that Climate Change could cause destruction to an area so close to UCSB. However I think that this is the point of the article, it talks about climate change to raise awareness of how society as a whole needs to prioritize climate change policies or face the consequences.

The article explains how climate change has become all too normal, where people like Terri Bowman expect and prepare for wildfires during the dry season. The normalization of wildfires, for example, is dangerous because we run the risk of justiciting wildfires as a typical event we must always be alert for. Before this class, I was not aware of the fact that wildfires were caused by the climate crisis. More or less, I thought wildfires were a natural occurrence that were meant to happen in order to get rid of old plants and make way for new ones. Therefore, I considered wildfires to be normal and not all that too important. However, I now understand that the magnitude and intensity of these wildfires are unprecedented, unnatural, and man made disasters. All of California has been experiencing the effects of climate change for years. Areas, such as Santa Barbara, a city that prides itself as being the inspiration behind Earth Day, after the oil spill of 1969; has yet to invoke environmental policies. Santa Barbara has down little in comparison to what it should be doing. The lack of initiative on their part is the result of prioritizing the aesthetics of the city. Santa Barbara is the weekend getaway of the wealthy, therefore it has to maintain a certain appearance to attract the wealthy and thereby keep business running as usual. It is not all that shocking that Santa Barbara scales in favor of the tourist business rather than environmentalist activism, because one options make them money whereas the other option (less preferable) cost them money. At the end of the day, I believe that everything comes down to money, how much money would the investment cost and is it worth it? Therefore, I strongly agree with Edward France statement, “we’re willing to make a change...but never willing to take the step that really change things and that will cost change.” The lack of action due to money is not only unique to Santa Barbara. The Coachella Valley, where I am from, is also subject to the same conditions. The valley is known for its 90s inspired resorts and massive golf clubs. Whenever, I drive by a resort, for example, I see gallons and gallons of water being wasted onto already green grass; it's all ironic because news networks constantly reports about the fact that our valley is experiencing severe droughts (has been for the past few years) and goes on to give us tips on how to preserve water. Yet these businesses prefer to waste the limited water we have in order to keep their appearance to that business does not seem affected by the climate crisis.

I'm from Los Angeles so the fires that have sprung out in the Santa Barbara County are pretty new to me. I think that Santa Barbara and Los Angeles are very different and I see the differences more and more every time I visit home. You could hardly see the building in LA when getting close to the are because the smog just covers them up, it's crazy! It was crazier realizing that my hometown is so polluted and that I was breathing this contaminated air all my life and never noticed just how bad it was. The traffic in LA is also SO bad! I realize now that we ARE the traffic, people choose to live like this; so many people drive alone instead of carpooling or using public transportation, we're responsible for not only the traffic but the large emission of carbon dioxide that we release. LA also has sooo many people, I feel like every time I come back home I see more people, more fast food restaurants, more cars, more buildings! You can hardly see any nature out here unless you live in the hills. 
<br><br>
When I read "2 degrees C: Beyond the Limit" I was surprised that Ventura is the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states. I honestly would've thought that it would be LA, since LA's air has gotten to the point where its "Unhealthy Air Quality for Sensitive Groups", on a day like this downtown LA and any surrounding neighborhoods are covered with a grey sky that looks as if its going to rain.
<br><br>
Now that I'll be spending the next four years in Santa Barbara I worry about its environment and what could happen in the next few years since its most prominent fires like the Thomas and Cave fires have been in the past couple of years.

In the article “2 Degrees Beyond the Limit”, the most astonishing aspect that Scott Wilson brought up was the erosion of the cliffside in Isla Vista, California. He described how “the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean are disappearing with the rising sea” on Del Playa Drive. In my opinion, living on Del Playa is almost a right of passage as a UCSB student, and the thought that I may not be able to is saddening. My dad went to school here at UCSB 30+ years ago, and he lived right on Del Playa Drive during his days as a student. When we came back to Isla Vista to visit UCSB when I got into school here, he was astonished at how much of the cliff was gone, and how the backyards were so much smaller than before. When I have children, if they were to ever visit Isla Vista, I will have to tell them about how Del Playa used to be there, and is now basically ‘in the ocean’ as I might picture it. It is the mere fact that my children will never get to experience living on Del Playa, especially with the way that humans are contributing to rising sea levels today.

I completely agree with you! One of the most alarming features discussed in Scott Wilsons, “2 Degrees Beyond the limit”, is the idea of cliff erosion, on the Del Playa Coast, due to sea-level rise. It is super interesting to hear from your dad’s perspective since he lived here and how much it has changed since then! I think it is also important to note that as Wilson states, “If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and the political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?” Clearly, most students at UCSB immensely appreciate the environment, we are so lucky to live in, shown in how many people wanted to take this class, and the numerous eco-friendly groups and clubs we have on campus, etc. But how can we expect others to change their ways so drastically if we (a community that heavily prides ourselves on our environment) can’t even uphold those changes ourselves? It is also heartbreaking to hear about the experiences people have faced due to temperatures rising. For example, the effects are seen due to the Thomas Fire in 2017, which was the largest in state history at the time, burning more than 281,000 acres. It is heartbreaking to hear that residents in Santa Barbara now see fires as an annual occurrence that they must face, even though it should never be seen that way. The only deterrence from this article is the fact that there are no peer-reviewed studies that support the conclusions about temperature rise. Although I believe that his statistics are close to accurate, without having support discredits the author and the article for me.

I found it very interesting the hypocrisy that Santa Barbara has the image of being a key player in environmental advocacy, yet the county went perfectly the wrong direction after 2007. This inability to act is well-explained by the article when it states that SB is more concerned with how they look than how they actually act. “Much like the people in it,” was what I was thinking when I read that. It’s not that politicians have bad intentions, but for any reasonable progress to be made, stricter, non-negotiable mandates should be put in place. The article states that, “the Climate Action Plan imposes no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals.” Hey Santa Barbara, that’s not a Climate Action Plan, that’s a “proposal for possible action plan,” not as catchy. To make tangible progress towards reducing SB emissions, impose real economic sanctions on violators of said plan. 
<br><br>

Another thing that immediately grabbed my attention was the idea that free parking was directly causing climate change. How ludicrous is it that we are so unready to compromise that we are literally compromising the health of future generations for free parking? 
<br><br>

I want to preface this next point by saying no one should ever have to feel the drastic, negative consequences of climate change. I would never wish that pain on anyone. That being said, it sucks that coastal California, where we largely believe in climate change, has and will continue to be hit very hard by natural disasters while people like Mitch McConnel and Ted Cruz (who “don’t” believe in climate change) won’t be hit by these effects as hard where they live. It may make it harder to take big oil money if their houses burned down or their family was injured.

In this week's article, “2 C: Beyond the Limit”, it resembles what was said by Wells last week but a little bit closer to home. This well structured article by Scott Wilson gives insight to how climate change is affecting our very own community here in the Santa Barbara and Ventura area. It was rather disappointing to read about how even a city that is vocal about fixing issues regarding climate change has been underwhelming in the actions it has been taking to better the environment. As I read this article there was simply not just one thing that stood out to me, but it was the many points referenced in this article. Beginning with the rise in temperature in Santa Barbara by 2.3 degree Celsius since 1895. It is absurd how much the temperature has dramatically risen in just the past 125 years. It is hard for me not to be annoyed at the lack of response to the temperature changes when the evidence is right in front of our very eyes. These dramatic changes in temperature have been the cause for the recent and unusual  fires, mudslides, winds, and droughts. In just the past few years all four of these things have been experienced right here in Santa Barbara and the city is still struggling to take action because it might cost too much. 

<br><br>

Two other points that caught my attention was the section of the article that was explaining how farmers in the area have been affected by the climate changes. To start I found it unfortunate that in just one year Farmers and Ranchers from Santa Barbara experienced a 5% decline in revenue as harvests failed and orchards failed to recover from the extreme weather and events. As farmers prepare for these trends to continue they are beginning to change what they are growing to crops that do not require as much water. This is a proactive approach to something that does not seem like it is going to get better anytime soon. Lastly, a line that stuck with me throughout the article that I did not want to believe, but eventually got through to me was, “Santa Barbara is more concerned about how it looks rather than how it lives.”  This was a tough pill to swallow as I have known Santa Barbara to be one of the most environmentally friendly cities that I have been in. It is something that I struggled believing until I finished the article and how bad it is beginning to look as of right now. It is only going to get worse if nothing is done, we always tend to talk the talk but now we must walk the walk.

I agree that it was eye opening to read about all the consequences of climate change occurring in a place that we have all started to call home. The face that the big fires and floods weren't even taking place before 2016 and then suddenly became an "annual event" clearly demonstrates the changes that are occurring. Before these dangerous natural catastrophe most had the mindset of "important but remote." The climate is growing hotter, drier, and windier, which is fueling the intense fires, and those fires are then leading to the climate being even hotter and drier. I was not aware that Ventura, a city that is in such close proximity to us here in Santa Barbara, is the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states. This piece also brought the Thomas Fire that took place here in Santa Barbara county to my attention. This intense fire led to 23 deaths caused by steep hillsides above town collapsing and carrying some of them out of their house and to sea. This article became even more personal to me when I read that the cliffs by Del Playa were disappearing because of the rising sea and that those that have houses on Del Playa now won't even be able to come see it in a few years because unless conditions change 78% of the city's bluffside beaches would be taken over by 2060. Reading about how this place will be so different in a few years because of ignorance by some believing that climate change isn't real even though the evidence is clear and right in front of their eyes hurts me. I agree with your point that things are "going to get worse if nothing is done, we always tend to talk the talk but now we must walk the walk."

The article "2*C: Beyond the farthest point' was an intriguing reminder to me. At the point when I came to UCSB, I realized the grounds was a charming spot and the way of life with respect to environmental change was extremely dynamic. In spite of how a lot of work UCSB has just added to battling environmental change, it has not been sufficient. 
<br><br>
In spite of the fact that these realities are startling, I felt that the article didn't concentrate enough on what we can improve this issue. It spoke to a portion of the endeavors Santa Barbara has made like advancing toward sustainable power sources, yet I feel that this article will have no genuine impact on individuals' eagerness to change on account of its to some degree unclear nature as far as evolving. Numerous individuals forgo individual change since they accept that one individual can not have any kind of effect, however articles like this one ought to alarm individuals of steps they can think about to literally change the destiny of the atmosphere and planet. From what I've seen and encountered, the best route in spurring individuals to assume responsibility for their lives is bringing up the accurate impact they are having on the atmosphere and cautioning them of what they have to do to transform it.

I could not agree with you more. I too was enamored by the beauty surrounding me when I came to school at City College and UCSB. Now, as a senior I look back and realize that I have experienced all two of the three largest fires in California history first hand. My sophomore year I saw how devastating the Thomas Fire actually was and how bad it effected the air quality. Finals were cancelled and everyone went home, however, I was scheduled to shoot a short-film that week. Though, IV being empty actually benefitted our shooting plans, the air quality was awful and our crew had to wear masks the entire three days of shooting. Even my film itself was impacted by the quality of the air, what was to be scenic, blue sky panoramic shots turned into a dark dystopian looking glow. Fast forward to November 2018, I am in a car on my way to camp in big sur with a few friends, one of them being from Malibu. We camp for two days and our way back without cell phone service. My friend Weston's house burned down during our camping trip, luckily his family was safe, but I will never forget his reaction. Since then, Weston has taken initiative in fighting climate change. This makes me wonder how far mother nature has to push us until we listen.

When I first came to Santa Barbara, I felt it is a pretty place with beautiful scenes and pleasant weather. However, when I read the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit,” I am shocked that the average temperature in Santa Barbara has increased by 2.3 degrees Celsius over the years. But people still do nothing to help with that. Just like Leah Stokes, a political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, says that “in our own backyard, we are not nearly as progressive as we think.” As the temperature grows higher, deadly mudslides, intense wildfires, and extreme drought become more and more often in Santa Barbara. Last time I saw the wildfires in Santa Barbara, I was escaping from Santa Barbara to LA. Although I didn't directly see the fire, in the air was the smell of burning. After that fire, I received a warning about mudslides in Santa Barbara. At that time, I knew that environmental problems were so close to my life that I needed to do something to protect the environment in my daily life. If we do nothing to protect our surrounding environment, we may lose our beautiful Santa Barbara in the future.

In the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit”, the author writes about the negative influence of climate change on California’s temperature, ecology, geology, economy, and people’s living condition. In the beginning, he mentioned two huge fire in Sherpa and El Capitan Canyon in continued two years. These fire created a lot of troubles for local residents and even forced them to immigrate, leading mudslides and extreme drought after that. Some farmers had to change their choice of crops in order to reduce the loss. Meanwhile, the costal curve bends from Santa Barbara to Mexico led to the ecological loss, including bird species, kelp forest, and whale population, companying with rising temperatures. The climate crisis eventually threat people’s lives in California. The author indicated that people once think of the refugee crisis in other places in the world but they never think of trapping themselves in the climate crisis. Though some people have already acknowledged the negative consequences of climate change, they still refuse to take action. The most surprising and ironic statistic is that the greenhouse gas emission of Santa Barbara excessed its 2007 level by 14 percentage, even though it was the birthplace of modern environmental movements. Thus, simply understanding or believing in the climate crisis and its negative consequence is still hard to advocate more environmental-friendly lifestyles. Just as the author says “ Change things caused nothing but never willing to take steps that really change things”. Thus, more actions and policies are going to improve. The situation, including the limitation on the use of electricity and water. I think there should be more laws and compulsive policy to force people not to waste resources. Also, public transportation should be advocated more since daily commutations have a huge impact on the emission of greenhouse gas.

After reading the article “2 Degrees Celsius: Beyond The Limit”, I find the problem is really serious. Global warming is effecting people’s life in many different ways. It has caused the rising of sea level, the higher temperature in winter, and the melt of glacial. In the article, it said it was only 2 degrees increased in the Santa barbara. For each people, 2 degrees can mean nothing. Nevertheless, for this planet, where is our only home, it will certainly cause a huge difference. So what we should do is to try our best to prevent the global warming and reduce the damage we caused to earth.

After reading the article “2°C: Beyond the Limit,” I felt overwhelmed by seeing that such severe consequences of climate change could happen so close to home. The average temperature of Santa Barbara has risen over 2.5 degrees since 1895, with the neighboring city, Ventura, rose about 2.6 celsius after being industrialized, being the top one region that has the most extreme temperature change in the United States. This is no doubt a very shocking statistic. As a foreign student fairly new to the United States, I have also imagined Santa Barbara (or, California in general) as a beautiful place that attracts lots of tourists with clear blue skies, green tries, natural beaches, and fresh breeze. Never have I ever know that such a beautiful place has really dark climate-related issues that are already posing dangerous threats to the every-day life and the wellbeing of its fellow people. The devastating impact on natural environments and animal species is quickly forthcoming: the loss of moisture and growing heatwave damaged most of the redwood forests and Joshua trees; the bird population drastically declined due to the loss of habitats. The even worse situation has also happened in our school. According to the article, one of the apartments has experienced a bottom-fall due to the high erosion rate. It completely shocked me to learn that over 70% of coastal buildings will face the consequence of erosion by 2060. 

<br><br>
This article, however, prompted me to think deeper about modern people’s motivation toward taking action. For some people, they might be reluctant to make a change because they didn’t physically experience the negative outcomes of climate change by themselves. As a result, they might easily take what is being said by the scientists as fake or exaggerated, or even worse, political propaganda. Thus, it is super important to extend the boundary of climate education and prompting people to understand the severe reality that we all have to face as human kinds.

After reading "2°C: Beyond the Limit," I too felt very overwhelmed by the extreme facts and the consequences Southern California has had to face due to climate change. Sabrina points out the rise of Santa Barbara and Ventura County's average temperature, and that is one of the topics of the article that struck me as well. A quote that stood out to me was: “The coastal curve that bends south from Santa Barbara through the Los Angeles metroplex to the arroyos along the Mexican border is warming at double the rate of the continental United States." The fact that the rate of warming is double the continental rate is shocking, especially in a place that is associated with such beautiful weather all year round, and a welcoming climate. Like Sabrina said, the weather is what attracts most of the tourists to Southern California. I grew up in Los Angeles, so it is odd to now see Southern California going through this incredible rise of temperatures, some of the fastest in the country. The repercussions of climate change explained in the article also caught my attention. The fact that some of California's once-prominent desert habitats lost 43 percent of their species in the last century is heartbreaking. Those animals have no responsibility for climate change, yet they are the ones who feel the consequences first.

It's particularly disillusioning that a significant impact of the climate crisis is happening on our very campus, county, and state. The proximity of the crisis, and even the relative inaction in Santa Barbara politics, makes the crisis so much more real for me as a student as UCSB. While the incredible beauty and temperate climate of Santa Barbara does reflect its history of environmental activism, I would never have suspected that politics in Santa Barbara is "not nearly as progressive as we think.” With the lasting impact of the 2017 Thomas Fire and the already-eroding bluffs on Del Playa, this article is likely to inspire our students to lobby for environmental regulations in Santa Barbara county. As concerning as the extreme weather events across the planet are, UCSB students are particularly likely to mobilize after realizing the climate crisis is threatening the beautiful weather, skies, and beaches we know and love.

I totally agree with your point about Santa Barbara not being as progressive as one would think. I always thought of Santa Barbara, and California in general, to be a quite liberal place. I also really liked your point about UCSB students taking action. I feel like Santa Barbara is lucky in a way to have a college community that would willing to take action against such an important issue.

In this article, the author clearly introduces how animals, forests and some other lives or even people are under the influence of the increase in 2 degrees in average temperature. In daily life, when people tell me “Do you know that the average temperature of this place has already increased by 2 degrees?” I may answer that “oh? It is only 2 degrees, which is a really small amount. We do not need to care about this.” However, after reading this article, I noticed that this thing should not be despised. 
<br><br>

Santa Barbara, given a title as “the birthplace of the modern environmental movement”. However, scientists and governors in this place still could not control the increase of the temperature and reduce the production of CO2 effectively. This is really a ridiculous thing. How do people in other places consider this? They may hold the opinion that even this place cannot solve this problem, we may not solve it too and we do not need to try it because we clearly know it will fail. As soon as more and more people consider this, the problem of climate change cannot be solved. To be honest, I must admit that people are a group of life that is selfish. We can do everything under the condition that it will not influence our property and value. However, as long as the action taken by the local government will influence our rights and benefit, no matter if these actions are solving our future or not, we will stand out and reject this to be taken place. 
<br><br>

In one word, I totally feel a sense of emergence after reading this article. For an international student who studies in Santa Barbara, I want to do something to help this place to stay away from the disaster unfeignedly. We must do some actions that may sacrifice our own profit and benefit in order to have a better life in the future.

"2 degrees C: Beyond the limit," spoke to me because I too feel we need to be alarmed and that we may be too far gone to reverse this damage. I think we think that this issue is so significant that we have no power and that we must let the government save us. We cant genuinely make a change because it's way bigger than us. That is the reason I, too, believe that it is going to be too late to save us. I was alarmed that Santa Barbara's weather has been relatively stagnant till 2016. Now we have these juristic environmental events happening, such as fire and erosion. Santa Barbara has also been doing so little to solve this issue. Also, in Santa Barbara, there have been new oil rig approvals granted, putting more emissions in the atmosphere. I believe that Santa Barbara needs to care more for its people and its environment.

I agree that everyone should feel some sort of urgency at the fact that our backyards are already experiencing the effects of climate change. It's one thing to see the flooding in Miami and want to make a change, but when it is your community being affected I would hope that people would feel alarmed enough to step up and try to make a change.

In the article “2C: Beyond the Limit” Wilson touches on an interesting idea that “If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?” This is clearly a concerning concept to have to come to terms with, whether you live in Santa Barbara or not. There is some obvious disconnect between society and the reality of climate change. Many people don’t pay attention to climate change or acknowledge what’s going on until something drastic happens in their own neighborhood. Even after something happens it’s hard to stick to a plan of action. For example pledging to reduce gas emissions by 15% only to have them raise by 14%.

This is a point, that in my opinion is not brought up enough. It's more than using fossil fuels, its what we eat as well. Every facet of our American lifestyle is bad for the environment as everything (Food, clothes, electronics, etc) is shipped to us from far away and then we are wasteful with what we had shipped to us requiring us to repeat the cycle of manufacturing and shipping. But we don't know any other way of life we live in a world where we just constantly consume. This is exasperated further by the foods we like to eat are some of the most damaging things to the environment as 50% of greenhouse gas emissions (In terms of potency) are from cattle. That includes dairy products as well as meat products. The American lifestyle is a lot of fun but that fun comes at a global human cost. Even the greenest electorate is going to have trouble getting rid of beef. We as a society aren't willing to sacrifice our easy comforts for the planet and I don't know if we as a society will ever be at a point where we can do that.

Prior to reading this article, I always thought that Santa Barbara was one of the most progresive cities when it came to climate change policies. So after reading that Santa Barbara has not come close to meeting its climate change expectations, I felt pessimistic regarding the possibility of solving the climate crisis. Just like you said, if a place will a green electorate is unwilling or incapable of changing, then who can? This fact makes me fear that before the united states unites with other leading countries to combat climate change, a drastic event will have to take place that finally proves something needs to be done to all the climate deniers out there. The longer we wait, the more likely a devastating fire could wreak havoc on our homes.
<br><br>
This brings me back to the hypocrisy that is evident in myself and many people who believe in the climate crisis. You can understand the significance of the climate crisis, but if you still shop relentlessly and consume meat ruguraliy. You are just adding to the problem that you condemn. Because of this, it is going to take widespread lifestyle change to truly produce re

The question of “who will?” is something I think about constantly. As you stated, there is a disconnect between society and what we want to do about climate change, and what we actually do. But I don’t think it’s our fault necessarily. The changes we must make in order to really reduce our emissions, in my opinion, come at too much of a cost to the individual right now. It’s simply too expensive to change one’s lifestyle, or to drastic of a change for most people. The way our society operates is not conducive to an eco-friendly way of living; we are a fast-paced society, people need to get places and make a living, and unfortunately the environment is an afterthought when people have to get up early, take kids to school, work 9-5 to just in order to live, keep a roof over your head and have food on the table. It’s exhausting. We need a massive, collective shift in how we think and operate, and our infrastructure needs to shift with that. Unfortunately, we do not have a government that is capable of implementing changes like that due to a president that thinks climate change is a joke, and we most likely do “not” have the funds to support such a massive shift. We, of course, do have the money. For example, the government has spent over $1.1 trillion dollars on National Defense. Do we really need to devote that much money to this area? Arguably not. I would bet most people would rather that money to do aiding climate change efforts and making our country more green. 
<br><br>

As you said, I think most people will continue their way of life until climate change affects them personally, then they will want to change. Otherwise, people need to either be heavily incentivised to change, or change needs to be made for them, most likely through government action. What do you think it would take for people to really change, other than being negatively affected by climate change?

After reading "2C: Beyond the Limit," the author Scott Wilson the local climate change events that are happening in and around Santa Barbara. Within recent years, there have been drastic changes such as cliff erosion, crop droughts and record breaking fires that have changed how we look at he environment with what can be done. I did not know myself the effects that having so little water was having on farmers, I only assumed the issues that come from it but to see it on a more personal level with farms who have to change their crops to save their livelihood is eye opening. I learned for the first time how contradictory SB was when it came to make changes of its own to combat climate change. We have to put aside the idea of making money through a harmful activity like that of  parking if we want to continue to bring people to SB to appreciate its beauty and be environmental friendly at the same time. I have been more motivated myself after reading this article because I know the truth of how SB is treating its environment as I like so many others would like to be apart of the solution rather than the problem.

I agree that I'd want to be apart of the solution rather the problem. Thinking of the beautiful attraction of Santa Barbara, I feel that the city tries to keep its touristic heritage and will try anything to increase this. Parking, as the writer used, was a big part of this, as it bring many people to attractions and boom the economy here. I feel that the students need to act on this situation, and support the legislation that called for more housing rather parking structures, as this strategy might reduce car use (and CO2 emissions) in Santa Barbara.

After reading Scott Wilson’s “2 C: Beyond the Limit”, I found the thing that shocked me the most is not the fact that the temperature is rising so rapidly, which we have already been told hundreds of times, however, the most astonishing part is that we really can see and feel the bad effects it brings and the bad results are so close around us. Since we have already heard so many news about the rising temperatures and global warming, and actually we can’t feel the temperature changes obviously, so people become careless about these and pay nearly no attention so these. However, the forest fire, the floods, droughts, even hurricanes are so different from all of those, they are the real catastrophes that we can easily see and they are happening around us so seriously.
<br><br>
In addition, it’s not strange for me to see that many people oppose the policies that may help the environment and alleviate the bad effects. Since many people focus the most on their own profits, mainly economic aspects. They will never agree to the seemed “useless and won’t benefit” them policy, since they don’t think that global warming really affect their lives. But, the truth is just the opposite, there are statistics listed in the article that “Last year, Santa Barbara farmers and ranchers took in $1.5 billion in revenue, a nearly 5 percent decline from the previous year”. According to these, if we still do nothing and keep being hopeless, the earth would be ruined and if we don’t even have a place to survive, how can we make the so-called profits that will benefit ourselves.

I agree completely. Most people disregard the warming statistics that have been told, either because we cannot feel the warming or because we have heard it so many times. However, the reports about the buildings on Del Playa and personal accounts from the Santa Barbara politician, supervisor, and business owners hit home for me. We all want to believe that we won't be affected, but the statistics, especially about Santa Barbara and Ventura country, show that we will. I remember when I was leaving for thanksgiving break, driving up towards the Bay Area, and seeing the glow of the cave fire reaching over the hill. I had never seen a fire like that, and it was truly jarring. 

<br><br>

However, for me, I was very surprised at the difficulty of pass environmental legislation in somewhere that seems that so environmentally motivated. This was especially shown to me in the statistic that the emissions in Santa Barbara had increased by 14% while the goal was to reduce emissions by 15%. You want to believe that environmental legislation is going to be harshest in somewhere that is experiencing climate change effects, but that is proving to not be true. I am left with the sentiment expressed in the article "if not here, where?".

After reading the article I was amazed at what was going on in my own backyard, coming from Ventura, I had no idea this type of temperature rise was happening. It seems like now in this age, fires just keep springing up here and there and are followed by large rainstorms which only leads to more destruction. I found it concerning that the Santa Barbara government was doing little to lower emissions throughout the county, as one of the places where I see a lot of effort in the community towards climate change, I expected more. I have personally been witness to so many fires around my community and had friends lose homes to the fires, I find it troubling that more isn't being done to fix these problems. As California is one of the biggest agriculture producers in the countries, we are at the frontlines of climate change, and fluctuations in temperatures only causes more problems for our community, as farmers are forced to change their ways of lives in order to make a profit in these times. We can even see the effects in our own backyard as the cliffs of isla list continue to erode as balconies fall into the ocean. Another big sign is in Ventura where the city had to place up fencing due to the fact that erosion had taken away parts of the parking lot creating safety hazards for people walking by. As a resident of both Santa Barbara and Ventura County, I can't help to worry about what the future entails if nothing is done to fix this.

I too was shocked to hear how much Ventura’s temperatures have risen. If you had asked me where I thought the most warming was coming from in California, I would have never guessed Ventura. I moved from Napa to Santa Barbara over a year ago, and I can at least say people here do seem to care more about the environment and at least have somewhat of a dialogue open on the subject. You don’t hear things like this in Napa, not even after the Tubbs Fire that happened in 2017. It just goes to show how we, as a state and country, are not yet unified on the subject of climate change, and how we actually need to be in order to actually make changes. The signs are all around us, yet we remain ignorant and apathetic towards the problem. I am unsure of whether we will be able to do something before the issues get worse, to the point of no return, but we all need to stop talking and actually take action, especially within our government, as we might depend on them to make changes that will wake us up on how big of a problem this really is.

Just the article title alone grabbed my attention. This was one of the more relatable climate change issues since it is talking about issues in California instead of something that is real but not as tangible to see such as rising sea levels. As a second year, I did not get to experience the Santa Barbara fires that got class cancelled a few years back but I can not imagine having to be prepared for fires like bowman. It is terrifying how just a 2.3 degrees celsius increase causes all of this damage. It is disappointing that the US did not decide to follow the Paris agreement and contributed to the planet warming by over 1 degrees celsius. 
 <br><br>
I did not know that Santa Barbara was also falling short of its antipollution goals. This angers me since Santa Barbara prides themselves of being such a green city. It is saddening that Santa Barbara fell away from its goals due to personal interests rather than the good of the overall community. As some who lives in Isla Vista, it is scary knowing that the cliff area is soon disappearing due to the rising sea level. I have always known that the cliffs would soon decay but did not know there were actual  homes that were already lost to the cliffs. 
 <br><br>
I have never heard of global weirding before and find it very alarming that the last time it happened in Santa Barbara was 149 years ago. The decline in resources makes it harder for ranchers and farmings to make a profit. It is sad that we soon have to think of w a world without world. I am glad a lot of farmers are choosing to go more eco friendly and planting crops that needs less water.
<br><br>
 When I first read the article title, I was confused by the reference of free parking. I did not know that the amount of cars are correlated with how much free parking there is. Santa Barbara has the struggle like many other cities to actually make a change that will cost sacrifice. I am hopeful since there has been minor progress such as the move for more renewable energy. Santa Barbara is my home for the next few years and I also need to make sacrifices to make this city as green as it claims to be.

As someone that experienced the Thomas fire and the subsequent mudslides, I can tell you that it was one of the most stressful times my peers and I had in our lives. It was my first quarter of college when the fire happened, and I can remember how quickly the situation changed. It was a crazy time because finals were cancelled literally the night before finals week.
<br><br>
I remember feeling angry at the university for not being more proactive during the whole thing. They were slow to hand out face masks, and they kept trying to keep finals week on schedule despite the raining ash and orange sky outside.

It really is shocking that Santa Barbara is falling short of its anti-pollution goals. The city has prided itself in being "green" but cannot manage to actually be "green."

Before reading the article “2°C:Beyond The Limit” I was unaware of the Paris Agreements that states that the average temperature rise worldwide should be well below 2 degrees . I also was not aware that in California this limit has been surpassed in some areas, and this is a mind blowing concept to me as the temperature rising more than 2 degrees Celsius did not seem possible to me before I read this article. It is also sad to see that Ventura, a county so close to us, is the county with the quickest warming rate in the lower states. This article has opened my eyes to the fact that me myself and my peers living in Santa Barbara are already being effected by climate change in ways that are unexpected and could ultimately be detrimental to many lifestyles. The fact that climate change in Santa Barbara has been effecting the revenue for local farmers (down 5% in 2018) really stood out to me as I had never thought the crazy weather events that we have been experiencing would impact local business with such a force. The fact that people are now producing tropical plants that have a better chance of survival instead of native species is a sad showing of what climate change can do to a culture, and also shows just how bad the effects of climate change have been on the agriculture community. Overall, this article makes me more aware that climate change is becoming a concept of inevitable doom, and makes it very clear that action must be taken quickly if we are going to stop this madness.

Upon reading “2c Beyond the Limit,” I also could not believe how much climate change has impacted the central coast. It was also difficult to read the ways in which climate change has impacted the area. Our professor, for example, stated that flooding seemed like the greatest danger to the central coast. However, the climate crisis is unpredictable in many ways, as we have seen in both the article and the video. For example, the amount of fires that we have experienced in both Santa Barbara and Ventura county have significantly increased and become more intense within the last century. The fires therefore, are not a product of sheer coincidence, but rather climate change. 
<br><br>
I also think it is upsetting to see that climate change is affecting the livelihood of farmers and small businessmen, who have lost cattle, good harvests, and have had to change the crops they are harvesting. “Global Weirding,” as used to define this phenomenon, has been affecting individuals in a multitude of ways. An example is the emergence of Agave as a possible plant to harvest, as it does not demand so much water, as opposed to other plants, such as avocados, which have yielded less and less produce due to the intensification of climate change.
<br><br>

One thing that I do think about a lot from the time I have lived in Santa Barbara is the amount of wealth that it exalts. Therefore, the preservation of wealth in Santa Barbara is something that is of high priority in the county. Therefore, when I read in the article that Santa Barbara is “often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives,” I was not surprised. Santa Barbara itself has been marketed as a tourist destination for its opulent Spanish influenced buildings and Spanish history. There is a large amount of large socioeconomic stratification, something that you usually see in very dense cities. Concrete changes in Santa Barbara to address the climate crisis, are not something that is done, but rather only written on paper in order to present itself as a liberal county to others.
<br><br>

As explained in the article and the video, climate change should not be viewed as something distant and remote since unusual occurrences have happened and as well consequences have been occurring in fires, temperature, and flooding. Our professor uses the tornado warning in Santa Barbara as an example- though it did not occur, this is concerning  since the central coast in California is one of the few true meditterranean climates on the planet.


<br><hr>
I was also unaware that the Paris Agreement stated that the worldwide temperature rise should not surpass 2 degrees and find it even scarier that I was unaware that parts of California have already surpassed those 2 degrees in temperature rise. This makes the whole idea of taking care of our home―planet Earth―even more personal and real, especially for people like me who were born and raised in California. I think it is crucial for everyone to be aware of the effects of climate change and the state of temperature rise that their home town or state is in. This way, people will be able to understand the effects of climate change through a perspective that shows its effects on the area they live in, their friends and family, and their personal lives. I also find it deeply concerning that climate change and temperature rise is negatively affecting local farmers and their revenues. This is something that people rarely take into consideration when they are grocery shopping or dining at a restaurant and I believe that it is something that everyone should give more thought to when making lifestyle choices.

After reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit," I was shocked that the effects of climate change drastically affected Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The average temperatures have been increasing an average two degrees celsius. We are in the danger zone in terms of how fast the climate should be warming up. The Thomas Fire is a big contributor to this increase in climate heating. It was one of the largest fires in state history, destroying homes and killing people. Hearing about the fire from my friends was quite shocking, but I had no idea that the damages were to this extent. Environmental activism is very prevalent in Santa Barbara, but this was the first time I was hearing about this. This is scary because if people in Santa Barbara are "falling short of its own anti-pollution goals," imagine how other cities are tackling the climate crisis. Rather than trying to lower greenhouse gas emissions, Santa Barbara has exceeded its numbers by 14%. Knowing that this is happening where I'm living motivates me to understand what went wrong and how I can contribute to the problem. This article is very informative and eye opening, making me more self aware of the problems in my community . 

<br><br>

I was also saddened to hear that the climate crisis has affected popular national parks in California. The increased heat could contribute to wildfires and the fast spread of them. The Joshua Tree is one of the parks affected by the heat and moisture loss. I love this park and have visited before, and hearing about this makes me very concerned for the sustainability of the park.

I completely agree with what you said! It was quite shocking to learn that Santa Barbara and Ventura county were experiencing such a dramatic increase in temperature and that both counties were well above the limit set by the Paris Agreement. I never expected Ventura to be the fastest warming county in the Lower 48 states. Because of this increase in temperature, fires are becoming more dangerous and impacting even more people as the danger zones are increasing. This is evident in the fact that within these last few years, California has experienced its deadliest and largest wildfires. It is scary to think that as a result of climate change and warming temperatures, a quarter of California’s 40 million residents live in high-risk fire zones.
<br><br>

I also found it interesting yet disheartening how despite the fact that Santa Barbara was the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, the county is falling short of its own antipollution goals. Prior to reading this article, I never knew that Santa Barbara was failing to measure up to these standards. I have always seen CalPIRG and other environmental groups actively working around campus to bring about change so I had assumed that the city itself was doing its part to better the world. I hope that Santa Barbara will be able to pick up its act and actually do what they say they will.

Growing up, the only thing I really knew about Santa Barbara was it was an idyllic beach town. When it came down to having to decide which college I wanted to go to, UC Santa Barbara’s climate played an important factor in my decision. Now living here for almost two years, it turns out I had no idea about the Santa Barbara climate that I had signed up for. After reading the article “2°C: Beyond the limit” it was startling to see how different our perception of Santa Barbara really is. As the reading notes, Santa Barbara that prides itself on being environmentally conscious is not really living up to their promises. The article claims that instead of reducing its emissions, Santa Barbara actually exceeded its levels in 2007 by 14%. While I am sure that Santa Barbara might be more active in combatting the climate crisis compared to other places, it’s still a shame to see that we have not made enough progress despite being one of the places in the U.S. that has actively seen the consequences of the climate crisis. It is also rather terrifying to think that 78% of the Santa Barbara’s bluffside beaches could be eroded by 2060 especially when so many homes are located directly on the coast. The consequences of the climate crisis are happening now and it’s right here in Santa Barbara. It’s vital that the city takes important steps in protecting this environment, or else future UCSB students and Santa Barbara residents will have a much different picture of beautiful Santa Barbara.

I had heard Ken mention that the average temperature in Ventura county/Santa Barbara county had been rising much more than the rest of the country, but this article really exposed me to just how bad the situation really is. The thermal maps that Scott Wilson implemented in his article were especially revealing. After completing Wilson’s article, I felt like I had had an epiphany. He was able to convey his message to the reader about the urgency and seriousness of the situation in the area we live without being too alarmist. Just mentioning the Thomas Fire alone as the third most devastating fire in California at the time had really shaken me. Climate change has reached us here, in our quaint, somewhat environmentally friendly town of Santa Barbara. While I found Wilson’s article very informative, I was skeptical about how he laid out some of this information. At the beginning of the section labeled A State of Change, Wilson is talking about the eroding cliffs along Del Playa Drive when he mentions how the city’s planning department had said that, “unless conditions change, erosion could claim up to 78 percent of the city’s bluffside beaches by 2060.” I think what’s difficult about making a statement like this is that people have such a hard time looking into the future about the possibilities of what can happen. This is especially true for older generations of people. I would say that the majority of people born in, say, the 1960’s don’t necessarily care about what’s gonna happen in 40 years from now because they won’t be here. It's a shame as well because like Ken 75% of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere happened over the span of his own lifetime. Even younger generations of Americans have a hard time looking into the future, especially when it comes to delayed consequences like climate change. 
<br><br>
Wilson also mentions how the “Climate Action Plan imposes no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals”, and this got me thinking back to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Wilson singles out the CAP for not imposing mandatory regulations, however the Paris Agreement, an international accord signed onto by tons of different countries across the world, doesn’t really have mandated regulations either. In fact the agreement strives for encouraging climate goals set by countries, but countries aren’t legally bound to follow these goals. One of the only legally binding actions is the measurement by officials on how far a country has come along on with their own goal. I just wanted to raise this point in order for people to compare and see similarities in how Wilson might infer that the Climate Action Plan in Santa Barbara is ineffective, even though it might be similar to a very large international accord that many people support. I thought that was interesting. One last thing I read in this article that stuck out to me was this quote from Edward France, the former Executive Director of the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition, saying, “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” I’ve never heard such a true statement before, at least one regarding the issue of climate change. I immediately think about all of the big interest oil companies that invest millions of dollars into debunking climate science. Even these people are putting in money in order to support their own cause. Meanwhile I feel like our local, state, and federal government is currently failing us by not even taking small measures, let alone large ones, in order to reduce climate change and improve the world we live in.

“2ºC: Beyond the Limit" was a very eye-opening reading. Not only does this article mention the consequences of climate change, but it focuses on Santa Barbara and Ventura county which is now home for many of us. I was surprised to see that Ventura was the fastest-warming county in all of California. What I also found interesting in the reading was the mention of cliffs such as Del Playa in Isla Vista eroding. It’s crazy to think that most of the homes located on that drive will disappear in the coming years. Future generations won’t be able to have that same experience as us. 
<br><br>

What also surprised me from the reading was the number of people who live in threatening areas. The article mentions that a quarter of California’s 40 million residents now live in high-risk fire zones. Wildfires have become increasingly common and it's devastating to look back on the damage they have done and what is expected to happen in the future. 
<br><br>

 With our climate becoming hotter and drier, many people are forced to change the crops they produce in order to adapt to our climate. The article mentions a few examples such as farmers now planting tropical crops like dragon fruit, finger limes, and coffee in order to switch to less water reliant crops. Because of droughts, they are left with no choice but to change their crops to suit our changing climate.

I agree with you completely. I was very suprised by the things that this article mentioned. I believe that the mentioning of areas very near to the students hear at ucsb really helps open eyes being that, like you said, this area is now our home.  Showing the graphs the inform us that we are in a high danger area truly concerns me. As a child I would always think, "dang i would nver live in a place that has tornados and such becuase thats so dangerous,". Thinking about that now showes that sometimes one just doesnt get the chance; sometimes the weather can change faster than ones lifestyle. Its scary how mcu hclimate change really effects everyone!

I think it is interesting how we are still astonished by the effects of climate change even when they occur in our own city.  I'm embarrassed to admit how much I have learned about my own home from “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" when most of the facts should be common knowledge.  There is simply not enough attention on how Santa Barbara has warmed by an average of 2.3 degrees Celsius, the effects of erosion on hill side architectures, the severe habitat loss, and how many areas in California are high-risk fire zones.  I didn't even know that the 2017 Thomas Fire was one of the largest in California's history, and I only learned last year the effects of sea level rise and erosion on houses on the shore when I participated in an environmental project where I learned about the damage of property from erosion, making the houses become barely habitable and extremely difficult to sell or restructure.  
<br><br>

I find my ignorance and the lack of public alertness toward the effects of climate change on human lives very concerning.  Climate change is no longer an intangible, future problem, it is now staring us right in our eyes, yet we still fail to focus enough on it, which could be devastating not only to the environment but to the economy through how much private and public property damage it would cost us.
<br><hr>
I agree with everything you've said in this comment. i think it's astonishing how ocean side DP will completely fall into the ocean in the coming years. Crazy to think that mountainside will become the new ocean side. just recently my friend's balcony fell into the ocean, so that really puts into perspective how rapidly the cliff is eroding. if you walk on the beach and look up at all the balconies they all look like they are hanging on by a thread. Our new home in Santa Barbara is falling apart before our very eyes, and we need to do something about it because it will only get worse. Thinking about how many fruit/veg that will go extinct because of climate change is scary and concerning.
<br><hr>
I didn't think we could be surprised even more but here we are, yet again. The fact that Ventura was the fastest warming county in California was also shocking to me, primarily because of how close it is to school. This article essentially highlighted how climate change is affecting our own backyards (Del Playa cliffs, the fires, oil pumping off the shore) and was, probably the most alarming out of everything we've read so far because of that fact. If the DiCaprio documentary didn't quite urge people to consider the climate crisis as a pressing issue that requires immediate attention, this article might have very well done the trick.
<br><hr>

You have mirrored my reactions to the article exactly.  The article hits very close to home, literally.  The idea that Santa Barbara could change so radically by 2060 is both infuriating and depressing, considering the fact that we are a part of the problem.  As the article says, though many of us are invested in the future and climate change, not much is being done.  And like you said, Ventura has been the fastest-warming county in all the county, after all! But, even after hearing all of this, I find it hard to make changes in my life, which I know is the same for many people.  Similarly, Leah Stokes commented on the hypocrisy with which our county deals with climate change: progressive in thought, but not in action.  Hopefully this changes before it is too late.
 <br><br>

As you talked about how terrifying it is that so many Californians face the threat of wildfire, I thought immediately of my best friend.  She has lived in Montecito since 2009 and loved the area, but when the Woolsey fire came, she was evacuated.  They spent the holidays in a hotel, finally returning home for less than a week before the mudslide hit.  One of her classmates died.  She was trapped in her home without electricity or running water for two days.  The intensity of the situation was unexpected and devastating.  As the article says, there was a 2 degree limit, but we are soon passing it.  I don’t want to know how much worse things can get; I don’t want this to be the beginning of the worst.
<br><hr>

I totally agree what you said. I was shocked when I read this because it is happening in our community. Like you said, this area is now our home. Climate change is much faster than I thought, and it literally effects everyone! However, I think most of us didn't realize that climate change is a serious problem yet, we should all concern about that.

<br><hr>
I totally agree. It’s crazy to think about the global climate change and how serious it is, but it’s almost frightening to know how short-lived this beautiful place may be because of it. Because of the large-scale erosion of the cliffs due to climate change, so many amazing parts of Isla Vista will be gone within 40 years if this continues. Before coming here, I know nothing of this. I knew there were massive fires, but not this close to campus. I had no idea how close we are to parts of this town and campus being destroyed.
 <br><br>
In addition, I really didn’t think too much of the tar on the beaches until reading this article. I guess I thought it was a kind of crappy beach, and that was that. However, after reading this, I became angered at the fact these large oil companies continue to drill so frequently, therefore ruining the oceans and beaches.

Reading the article, “2 degree C: Beyond the limit,” I was shocked to see how much the average temperature of Santa Barbara County has warmed since 1895, 2.3 degrees Celsius to be exact. This fact took me off guard because I always pictured California to be a very eco-friendly state and that it would be at the front of the line of keeping its average temperatures down. Especially the Santa Barbara area because we have signs all around campus and town saying to recycle and use less, yet our county is one the worst ones in California. I feel as though Santa Barbara County is a hypocrite because they preach about the importance of saving our planet when this county is part of the issue. Ventura happens to be the fastest warming county in the lower 48 states at 2.6 degrees Celsius which means we are only .3 degrees away from being considered the fastest warming county. I thought we would be doing more to prevent this, but I guess not. On top of this it has become normal for fires to occur yearly here, as if they have been happening for centuries. When I talked to my friends about the documentary I watched, one states “yea fires happen in that area every fall, so it shouldn’t have been a shock”. Climate change is the reason why fires are occurring more rapidly and becoming more dangerous everywhere, yes they might’ve happened without rising temperatures, but they would not have happened at the caliber they are occurring at today. Overall I found this article very eye opening and has made me even more aware of the things I do daily that contribute to rising temperatures.

 It is truly mesmerizing how much the Santa Barbara county temperature has changed. I completely agree with when you stated Santa Barbara was contributing to the climate crisis. It has become a trend for Santa Barbara to witness wildfires in this community. Santa Barbara must act now and take sustainability measures before it is too late.

I've always viewed Santa Barbara as being a very progressive city in terms of working towards becoming carbon neutral, and making a shift to renewable resources. However, this article exposed Santa Barbara as being a little more talk than walk, tarnishing the city's green reputation. While there has been progress according to the article, not too long ago, only one person was in charge of the city moving towards renewable energy, which is not nearly good enough. The effects of climate change in Santa Barbara are even more evident than they are in other places in the United States, as the article states that fire season is now effectively year round. People are forced to live in fear, and have plans as to what they'll do with their belongings, and even animals when fire strikes. I feel that this article touched very close to home, as just a few months ago, a fire broke out very close to campus, and while there was no destruction to campus, many who lived closer to the fire had to evacuate, and students could only watch helplessly from their dorms. Santa Barbara policy makers need to do more at a more effective pace to reduce its emissions, and make the change to renewable energy. It is a necessity, or fire may soon end up engulfing our campus, and potentially city.

"2ºC: Beyond the Limit" highlighted quite a few points that had not occurred to me before. I’d always just assumed that if a place and it’s people were willing to make changes to help the environment, then it would be done. But there are so many other factors that play into it. This article brings up a good point that “if a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?” Santa Barbara is known for environmental progressivism, with UCSB nearby- one of the greenest universities in the country, and yet Santa Barbara is still exhausting so many resources. 
 <br><br>

Another point that really made me think was about farmers are reacting to these changing environmental conditions. “Farmers are changing the types of crops they sell in order to accommodate these new conditions,“ by producing more drought durable crops. People are having to shift their entire livelihood in order to accommodate and it makes me wonder how quickly we’ll no longer be able to eat some of the foods we currently rely on.

I also thought that, with enough people willing to make a change in their lifestyles in order to curb global warming, Santa Barbara would surely become more environmentally conscious and less supportive of environment-wrecking equipment/procedures/companies. But, this article explained that there really are a lot of different blockages that must be bypassed in order for these changes to actually occur. I knew that these blockages were in place but it never really occurred that there were so many. It makes me wonder if people who want to make steps towards having the Earth become a greener planet will ever have the chance to speak their truth if no one in our government wants to listen (and those who want to are a minority).
<br><br>
A quote that really stuck with me was: “Then, a Unocal rig blowout cracked the sea floor, spilling 3 million barrels of oil, the third-largest spill in U.S. history. To this day, beachgoers find tar on their feet from the still-seeping oil.” This quote really hits home because I have actually seen tar on my feet after walking down the beach at UCSB. This should be a wake up call for the residents of Santa Barbara, but no one can really make a change because, even if they wanted to, the people backing oil rigs, fracking and similar environmentally degrading industries/companies have a lot of power and are able to continue with their horrendous deeds.
<br><br>

If seeing tar on your feet won’t call you to action, perhaps learning that your county is one of the fastest-warming counties in the lower 48 states will do the trick. People need to be informed about these facts because that is the only way we are ever going to be able to stop these powerful, havoc-causing companies. We need to all stand up for our environment. It can’t just be a few people. It has to be millions. Billions even. This the only way that we can make a change.

Every time I read an article or watch a film/lecture, it serves as a wake up call for me. I keep finding more things to be worried about. I have always only known about the set consequences and changes that would occur. I have learned about sea-level rise but now I am learning about the dangers of wildfires and possible tornadoes. Supervisor Das Williams is right when he says, "Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote.” Everyone feels drastic changes in our weather but everyone fails to realize that these other consequences are coming sooner rather than later. If it doesn't concern us in our everyday lives, it will continue to not concern us until we are face-to-face with a tornado.
<br><br>


A quote stuck with me from a farmer, he said, "I could step aside, and someone would replace me. Or I can change." What example would we be setting, if we don't do anything about our current state. We are making room for the next generation to repeat the same things. But if we change, we are setting up a better life for ourselves, for the future, and for lesser developed countries.

Before I read the article, I am like most people would think of the consequence of climate change is the sea level rising. After I read the article,  I realize the situation is different now. In the process of civilization, more and more greenhouse gas is emitted into the atmosphere. The sea level rising is not the biggest threat for us right now. The average temperatures in California have been increasing rapidly. The best evidence to prove this is as Professor Hiltner said the biggest wildfire happened in California keep breaking the record in recent years and Ventura which is 40 miles away from UCSB becomes the fastest growing county in the lower 48 states. The wildfire that happened in UCSB last year was a serious warning we should all be aware of because nobody knows which city will become the next temperature fastest-growing city. In the article, I felt very scared when I saw an apartment building collapsed because of the corrosion of the cliff. There are also many cliffs around UCSB. These cliffs are great places the view the sunrise or sunset from the sea level. Now because of climate change, it starts to become dangerous. Santa Barbara’s government tried to improve the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, it did not work out and the result was unsatisfactory which makes me very sad. As expected, people become selfish in the face of profit. On the other hand, it’s great to see the government at least took the action to solve climate problems. It means they realize a sense of crisis to climate change. I hope the government does not give up easily and keeps trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

When I first started reading the article, I thought that I would have already heard everything it had to say, as I was here for the Thomas fire and learned about the previous fires quickly after. However, I quickly realized that I knew almost nothing about how these fires have impacted my community. The article mentions that 23 people were killed by the mudslides that followed the Thomas fire. My first response was that the mudslides didn’t kill those people, our country killed those people by allowing our climate to get to this state of crisis. 
<br><br>


I also had a big response to hearing that some farmers have started shifting their crops toward less water reliant produce, such as switching from avocados to agave or finger limes. This made me think of how my parents tell me that bananas don’t taste the same way that they used to (because of all the ways growers have edited them to become the bananas we eat today). What it would be like if we basically phased out the avocado because we didn’t have the resources to grow it anymore? It’s sad to think about telling my children about a fruit that I used to love that they will never be able to try.

 While I wasn't here for the Thomas fire, I felt the same as you, that I knew quite a bit about them.  I took Earth 20, Geological Catastrophes, last year and we learned about both the fire and the mudslides.  However, we learned about them from an almost strictly scientific point of view.  We learned how they formed and what destruction they caused to the infrastructure and environment of Santa Barbara and Montecito.  This article went in depth about the human aspect, how people were impacted both during and after these terrible events.  I think your statement that it is the country's fault for letting get that bad is both a serious and true accusation.  If years ago we publicized (more than it had been) and faced the climate problem head on, those 23 people would likely have not lost their lives in this way.
<br><br>
I was also interested in how crops have changed, and will continue to change, over years to come.  Even now, in the plant-based society, we have been switching to more sustainable options.  Oat milk is quickly becoming as popular and available as almond milk.  Although it releases significantly less greenhouse emissions than regular milk (a gallon of which releases 17.6 pounds of carbon dioxide), almond milk takes significantly more resources than almond milk to make.
<br><hr>
I just recently visited the location where the Tomas fires happened.  It is a beautiful location that everyone should be able to experience.  It is a shame that we face this option of losing beautiful natural landscapes in our own backyard.  Not only are we losing wildlife, some people are losing their homes and even their lives.  This is a fact of the world that we cannot accept because we are prioritizing the convenience of cheap energy  over the lives of other people.  That is morally reprehensible and we must change this reality. 

<br><br>

I also agree about your concerns about losing a significant portion of California farmland.  We already struggle with droughts every year and finding enough water to give our crops, so it can only be made worse by fires.  A lot of my favorite foods, such as almonds, are pretty much only grown in California, which is a problem when the central valley is catching on fire every year and destroying billions of dollars of agriculture and land.

I’ve never had the chance to live in Santa Barbara until now and within these few months I experienced the cave fire that caused us to cancel school. As I was driving home I admittedly was very happy school was canceled; however, as I saw the whole mountain black I immediately lost the happy feeling. I experienced some aspects of “climate weirdness” first hand. Growing up in the central valley of California, I have been able to experience an abundance amount of livestock, orchards, and other industrial companies. For a job, I worked alongside many people picking the produce that California provides for this country and noticing the amount of time, effort, and people needed for this job was outstanding. There were some mornings that it was so cold the night before that it created a frost on the produce which then caused us to wait another 2 hours into the early 5 am start resulting in a long hot day ahead of us. It wasn’t until I read this article and watched this video that I realized such drastic change in weather was caused by the climate crisis. If the climate continues to rise as it is then it will create loss of the massive orchards in the central valley, causing many people to lose their jobs and the United States having less of the produce than before. The results of the climate crisis is being felt everywhere and it is affecting everyone and their lives.

As somebody who did not grow up in the US, but instead in a European country that is relatively safe from most climate change-induced natural disasters, the fire breaking out in Santa Barbara last year around Thanksgiving break was a huge wake-up call for me. For the first time in my life, I saw a wildfire with my own eyes, just up the mountain from UCSB. I remember looking out the window of my dorm room and noticing the dark red smoke in the distance and, soon after, the strong winds around campus. Since I have never experienced the threat of fires or tornadoes, I was ignorant of the reality of those situations and didn't think it could impact me as well. Although it is true that, at the moment, some areas of the world are more impacted by the consequences of the climate crisis, it is essential to realize that this will not be the case forever and eventually, nobody will be able to deny the existence of climate change anymore. 
<br><br>


The article mentioned that the three most severe fires in California history have happened in the past two years. Sadly, those devastations were necessary for some people to realize the gravity of the situation. I cannot imagine that anyone would be able to keep denying that climate change is happening after being personally affected by its consequences. However, we do not have the luxury to wait for people to be directly influenced by natural hazards to comprehend what's happening to our planet. By then, it will already be too late. Instead, we must act now. The article mentioned several methods of farmers adapting to the changing climate or new regulations implemented by the government to minimize the drastic transformation. Even though we undoubtedly have to learn to adapt to our changing planet, I feel like we should rather use all of that effort and time in addressing the root of the problem and changing our habits. If we only focus on inventing new technologies or other ways of adapting to the climate crisis, we are indirectly accepting that we cannot do anything about it. This is not the case, however, and we need to start to realize that we still have a chance. Hopefully, Wilson's article will encourage people to finally act and fight for a change instead of simply learning to adapt.

The article “2C* Beyond the limit” actually take us into real-life which influenced and damaged by climate change. And this is Santa Barbara. From the article, it clearly states forests, animals, marine lives like kelp forest and whales, crops in farms and animals in ranches are greatly influenced by increases in 2 degrees in average temperature. Here, climate change is no more distant but close to our life. We witness every change happening around us. 
<br><br>

Although there isn’t an expert or professional evidence to support the article, we know it can be true for most of the articles. We see news for the past of years reporting disasters that are caused by fire, flood, and mud, etc. We see fires flaming on the mountains near our living area last year here in Santa Barbara. Facing unpredictable weather changes, people do not prepare for the sudden weather disaster. Just like what professor Hiltner shares with us, the night that he planned to finish his lecture preparation, he and his family were told to leave because a tornado will come to them. They were not prepared and scared by the bad news. Many other people in California felt bad when they face the tornado. The society still needs to work on protection and quick responses to such a disaster.
<br><br>

Also, when I read the article, one problem hits my heart. Although Santa Barbara is a birthplace of the environmental movement and its governors promised to lower greenhouse gas emissions, the local government does not change its policies or work on improving the environment. Compared with 2006’s carbon emissions, 2016’s carbon emissions even increase by 14%. Just like countries that acceded on agreement in Paris with no reinforcement or punishments, governments cannot do nothing after they promise to change. Promises cannot be words on papers. We need actions right now. One thing that I feel ironic is that just at the bus loop near North Hall, I saw a sign on a trash can and the sign says “no waste by 2020” but at that time I realized it’s been 2020.

Current clear distance between political presidents’ stances on climate change are being brought to the forefront of political decisions. An issue that should be bi-partisan in nature is being marketed by the two-party system as a central point of contention. One such political move by current president Donald Trump is the violation and withdraw from the Paris agreement in which climate change issues would be set and regulated. The fact that the United states emits more CO2 per capita than any other country on this planet is a sign that our action could help reduce the worldwide emission of carbon into the atmosphere by a substantial amount. This is not just a national and global problem, this is an issue that affects us right here and right now. Santa Barbara and Ventura county are among the areas most heavily affected by climate change. Wildfires caused by an increase in dry brush scattered among the ground along with loss of moisture threaten other regions in California, including redwood forests and Joshua tree are particularly susceptible. Without decisive action, fires of a scale similar to the Thomas Fires and the La Brea Fires are almost inevitable. In our own county, Santa Barbara, our emissions of CO2 have increased by 14% in a two-year period from 2015-2017. Even though we pledged to reduce emissions by 15% we continued along the trend of continued pollution. I doubt that this trend has changed much since 2017, in fact it is my speculation that these numbers have most likely continued to increase.

I agree with you on the fact that climate change is an “issue that should be bi-partisan as a central point of contention”. We say that we have to act now and change our form of living and making all these promises of lowering our CO2 emissions but we have increased in 14% more of emissions when we had just said we were going to reduce it by 15%. That is really sad, we are doing the opposite of what we said we were going to do. Our professor said that Santa Barbara temperatures have risen by 2.3 ºC which is so much but Ventura’s County temperature has risen by 2.6ºC which may seem like a small difference but it actually is a huge difference in temperature considering the fact that we as humans are changing the temperature. I was also surprised to find out that the United States is one of the highest emitters of CO2 and we opted out of the Paris agreement. The one thing that made the United States look like they care about the Environment has decided to bail out of. This is sad to hear because it makes the public believe that this isn’t a huge issue that we are going through because our President says that climate change doesn’t exist. People will start to believe if he doesn’t care, why should I care. People are so blind that they don’t see what is the issue of Climate change when all of the effects are right in front of us. We can feel the change in temperature. Our winters in Southern California are not like the winters that I remember when I was a kid. We need to do something about climate change now.

People in southern California have become very used to fires, mudslides, and drought. In recent years, these events have been becoming more prevalent. The article, 2°C: Beyond the limit, relates all of these natural disasters to the increasing rate of climate change. The section of California from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border is warming at double the rate the rest of the continental US. Santa Barbara County has seen an increase in 2.6 degrees celsius. The article talked about a large fire that took place in 2017, the Thomas Fire. I wasn’t here at that time, but I remember my older friends coming home from break and accounting to me what happened and how their finals were canceled and they would have to wait until they went back in January. It’s terrifying to think that these kinds of fires are becoming more and more regular. Just this past November, there was another fire just before Thanksgiving break. Who knows, one day in the future we might have an even more extreme fire that could threaten our school. Growing up, I had only ever thought that in California, the only real threat was earthquakes. I know now, that fires probably have far worse impacts. Additionally, the article brought up how the cliffs along Del Playa are eroding at faster rates due to sea-level rise. It is crazy to think about how UCSB will look like 20, 40, 80 years in the future. With all of the fires, mudslides, and the rising oceans, will it even still be standing?

Throughout the article "Beyond the Limit" by Scott Wilson, one of the first things that kept standing out to me were statements like “we just cannot figure out why this is happening!" or "we are struggling to connect the dots!”. When there are other points in the article where they are blatantly talking about climate change and the raise in temperature which is causing this crisis. I may have been reading it incorrectly but from the first read I felt like the facts presented and some of the quotes used had a disconnect. I transferred to UCSB last fall and have been to the beach many times. I never thought to google search why there was always so much tar on our feet whenever we would head home, so it was interesting to come across it in this article. It is shocking to me that this oil spill happened in 1969 and we are STILL seeing the effects of it. Thats roughly 50 years later and the long term effect of it is still very present. I have lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and I never really had experience with fires that were close to me. The closest fires were Sonoma area but from me that was still about a 45 minute drive away. My family relocated to Los Angeles over the summer and within a couple of months I was watching online the evacuation zones as two separate fires about a month apart closed in on our house. Luckily there was no damage to our house but that was my first experience of having to choose small important things for my mom to grab before she evacuated. It is crazy to me that this climate is something that is a new normal and we have to get used to it and remain prepared. The issue with PGE in the last parts of the article explains perfectly why even being prepared isn’t enough. PGE cut power to thousands of homes which resulted in major devastation. They are now bankrupt with billions of dollars they are expected to pay in fire related liability costs and people aren’t sure if they will even get any of their lost properties reimbursed. If these fires are going to be a new normal in California then we have to create programs that protect people from the devastation that occurs during and after these kinds of crises.

“Beyond the limit” was not very surprising to read, but very saddening, especially being a resident of Isla Vista. I remember the Thomas Fire and how orange and brown the sky was and how much ash could be seen on the ground. I had no idea it was the largest fire in state history and it sucks to have to read “at the time” because that means another fire occurred that has now taken its place. There was a lot in the article that was frustrating to read. Scott Wilson points out the way climate change was not of graveness until it came across peoples’ paths, such as with Joan Hartmann. Wilson states, “she had never been forced to evacuate by fire until last year. She has since had to leave home twice.” It is now in our homes and we have allowed it to get this far. That is the cruel reality of today. Many did not see the effects of the climate crisis first hand until now. Now it is visible so now it is becoming important. That is extremely, extremely saddening, but it should have been important years ago but rather humans decided to take the world as their own and furthered a problem they knew they were creating and still are. Temperatures rising, extreme droughts and fires occurring, tornado warnings appearing, species dying and going extinct, all of it is still not enough to get EVERYONE to save the Earth. Human beings took everything for themselves and continue to do so. It is all quite depressing, but I understand the importance of being hopeful and still remaining optimistic. I have faith that we will be able to stop our destruction before it becomes too late. I know so many people that are passionate about the Earth that it can be done. I will continue to hope that everyone, especially those who neglect the climate crisis for money, will realize the grave importance of taking action today.

The facts regarding Ventura's rapid warming trends truly startled me but it shows how one location on the globe can be impacted much worse from climate change than another. Florida has been unofficially ranked as the worst state for climate change and this is due to Florida's low coastal elevation and geography, which is susceptible to flooding and sea level rise. While the effects of our carbon emissions may not be experienced directly or impact ourselves, the impacts of these emissions could influence others miles or hundreds of miles away. The takeaway is that we often excuse ourselves and our own behavior because of the thought of how small we seem compared to the global population, but our personal choices can affect global climate patterns and hurt different animals and humans all around the world.

Before reading the article,“2°C:Beyond The Limit” I had no idea that there are a couple places in California that have already surpassed the Paris Agreements 2 degree Celsius limit. This heat is what has been triggering the recent fires. I was not here yet when the Thomas Fire happened but I heard about it and how bad it was. Reading about it, it sounds and looked really bad, 281,000 acres burned sounds like days of bad air and ashes falling from the sky. This made more people believe that indeed the climate is changing yet there are still people; politicians who don’t believe or don’t care and Santa Barbara will keep heating. Since I am now part of Santa Barbara because I live here it isn’t good news for me, this article gives me a sense of urgency to be involved here at school and make a change. 
<br><br>
Something that stuck out to me from the article was the quote by Edward France “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something”, I agree with this 100%. Literally the U.S will not change to renewable energy or even care because they don’t want to spend money even though we produce so much greenhouse gas. We are to blame for what is happening with the climate, yet don’t take responsibility and probably will not until it is way too late. Another thing that stuck out was the man who spent so much money to try and secure his ranch and he ended up just going broke. The power was turned off and he couldn’t do anything about it because he didn’t have solar panels to power his home. This shows that the first thing to do to be prepared is to have renewable energy because if not there no point in other things that are electrically power, apart from electricity also being bad for the environment. Honestly though there is little to do at that moment when a natural disaster pops up, we have to do things before they even happen, something to avoid these disasters from happening.

I totally agree with you. To be honest, I did not pay much attention to the climate change before taking ENGL23 even though I have heard it. It probably because the influence of serious consequence is not significantly in my life. However, when I became a student at UCSB and saw the fire myself, I felt threatened. 
<br><br>

After reading the article "2℃：Beyond the limit," I surprisingly found out that climate change has already changed our life in so many ways. For example, Southern CA now grows hotter, drier and experiences more nature disasters, such as wildfire and mudslides. Also, the loss of redwood forests and bird populations are the result of climate change. What's worse, agriculture yield decreased greatly due to rising temperature and crop like avocados is no longer suitable for planting. Moreover, 1/4 population of CA is living in area that is under high risk of fire. Even if the truth is harsh, people are still not willing to make change that will cost something. The agreement about reducing parking number is not achieve due to conflict of interests. Maybe that's why the temperature increase beyond 2 degrees here. I really hope people be aware of the bad situation we are in and do something useful to improve our own living environment.
<br><hr>
I am so glad you were not in Santa Barbara during the Thomas Fire. It was my first year and first quarter at UCSB when the Thomas fire broke out the week before finals. I remember people struggling to find face masks to protect themselves from the unhealthy air quality. I even spent my birthday inside because the air quality was so bad to go out and celebrate. In all honesty, I never did research on the Thomas fire after it stopped burning, so this was the first time hearing that 281,000 acres were burned. That is so crazy! But seeing it first hand, I can't say I'm fully surprised with that number. 
<br><br>
Santa Barbara has become my home. It was heartbreaking to learn that unless conditions change, erosion could claim up to 78% of the city's bluff side beaches by 2060. It is unimaginable. But like the fire in Paradise, we have to prepare for the worst. I truly hope we make enough changes to beat the statement. 
<br><br>
I agree with you. I felt urgency to get involved at school and participate in organizations that spread awareness of the climate crisis in hopes of creating change within the residents of SB. The quote that resonated with me was the one said by a Professor, "But in our own backyard, we are not as progressive as we think". I feel like there are students and residents of SB in general that know of this issue, but not many who are taking action. And I am one of the many who do not take enough action. I feel guilty and it is time to make a change to save the planet and its people. Donating to organizations that are helping fight the climate crisis can be one action I can start doing monthly to contribute. I am excited to start researching more and become involved on campus.

After reading “Beyond the Limit” I was saddened, once again. This article seemed to be a little more frustrating to me than most because it discussed where I live, while offering no solutions of subsistence. I was shocked to learn that Ventura County is the fastest warming area in the lower 48 states. The article also states that the coastal curve is warming at a rate that is double the United States, which has accelerated in the last five years. While these statistics are alarming, most people still won’t feel the need to make a change. This alone is very frustrating as Santa Barbara, and in particular UC Santa Barbara, is suffering. Cliffs on UC Santa Barbara’s Del Playa Drive are eroding and crashing into the water, destroying homes and memories. Smog and heat are shifting weather patterns, hurting ocean and plant life alike. 
<br><br>

With this, the amount of wildfires that have occurred is astounding. Hearing that ¼ of California’s 40 million residents live in fire risk zones has made me reflect on my own experiences. Growing up in suburban Los Angeles and moving to Santa Barbara, I have experienced fires in my hometown almost every year. Our sheer lack of preparedness is absolutely correct, as California seems to never learn after battling a wildfire. With this, our lack of action is angering. As a young adult living in one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the country, we are simply not fulfilling our role. We continue to not enforce regulations on big businesses and corporations, letting pollution and greenhouse gases rise. In 2015 Santa Barbara said they would reduce emissions by 15%, and yet they are exceeding emissions by 14%. If one of the wealthiest cities in the country can’t make a change, how can we expect any other city to follow suit? Our plants and animals are suffering, businesses are getting destroyed, and the land is getting destroyed. This reading made me once again more committed to doing my part to make a difference, whether that is biking instead of driving, or eating less meat.

I was similarly frustrated by the lack of action taken to address some of these problems. Unfortunately, since climate change is driven on a global level, even though we are feeling the results locally there is little we can do as a town to combat effects such as sea-level rise, drought, and increased average temperatures. While that does not mean we shouldn't do all we can to reduce emissions and do our part, it is the unfortunate truth that this is a global problem that will be felt on a local and personal level until there is significant global change. 
<br><br>
One thing that this article made me think about is what we should be pushing for on a local policy level to respond appropriately to the reality that we are feeling some of the most extreme examples of climate change. I think that in addition to prevention measures such as reducing emissions to hopefully play a part in reducing climate change, we need to build infrastructure and write policies to prepare and respond to the effects of climate change that are going to affect this town. This could include measures such as seawalls, regulation about building defensible space around structures threatened by wildland fires, and creating drainage systems to deal with flooding. Additionally, we need to think long term about how life is going to change to cope with these effects. While it is disheartening to think these actions are more reactive than proactive, they are necessary in light of the points made in this article to prepare for future climate change-related disasters.

After reading "2ºC: Beyond The Limit" by Scott Wilson it was very heartbreaking as a resident of Santa Barbara and solely Isla Vista. I plan on living on Del Playa next year and luckily I do not have to suffice to any landslides, hopefully. But in the next coming years it will be truly devastating knowing that cliff side Del Playa will slowly come to its downfall. I was very shocked to see that by 2060, 78% of the properties on Del Playa will be gone! The fact that the percentage is so high is unbelievable to me. 

<br><br>

Agriculture here in Santa Barbara country is being affected the most with all the recent fires and rise in weather temperature. Farmers are starting to turn to more tropical crops because they can withstand with the heat. Environmentalists are plotting to get rid of parking lots and turning those spaces into real estate housing which is a good alternative way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions but would probably not comply to those circumstances.

In reading “2°C: Beyond the limit” and watching Ken’s video, although I have become truly worried of the consequences of the climate crisis already, I was slightly underwhelmed with its effectiveness. Perhaps this article, along with many others about climate, stands solely to deliver facts and information about the changing climate and the effects. Although these facts are frightening, I felt that the article did not focus enough on what we can do in the future to better this issue. It did speak to some of the efforts Santa Barbara has made like moving toward renewable energy sources, but I feel that this article will have no real effect on people’s willingness to change because of its somewhat vague nature in terms of changing. Many people refrain from personal change because they believe that one person can not make a difference, but articles like this one  should be alerting people of steps they can take to personally change the fate of the climate and planet. From what I’ve seen and experienced, the most effective way in motivating people to take control of their lives is pointing out the exact effect they are having on the climate and alerting them of what they need to do to change it.

I agree with you that the article “2°C: Beyond the limit” should have more of an alarmist tone and better indicate the things that we can do to do our part in the climate crisis. The article brought light to how Ventura county, our neighboring county, is the “fastest-warming county in the lower 48 states.” It is crazy to believe that this area is being heavily affected by the climate crisis, more so than other states. The article made me realize that, although this area is beautiful and it doesn’t seem like much is happening, acres are being burned down and our oceans affected. There is so much we can do, but this article does not give us that information.
 <br><br>
 The focus of fires is frightening to many people and it has led to the loss of homes, but people are still not taking action. Santa Barbara needs to reform its ways if we are going to do our part in protecting the environment. How is it that they allow companies propose something that will emit more greenhouse gas emissions into the air, but still want to make a difference in the environment? Even people who want to take action and protect themselves, such as a farmer who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on protecting his farm, couldn’t because of a power outage. As a collective, the people of Santa Barbara need to gather and decide what needs to be done to prevent things like this. This article, although could have been more detailed about what could happen to our beautiful Santa Barbara, does a good job in stating how the climate crisis has affected this area.
<br><hr>
Reading the article, “2°C: Beyond the limit”, I was shocked to see that a quarter of California’s 40 million residents now live in high risk fire zones. I was also saddened when the article talks about homes in Isla Vista being gone in a few years. Even though I just got to UCSB a few months ago, I have already grown a fondness towards the school and to Isla Vista, so thinking that one day it can all be gone due to climate change is terrifying. The 2017 Thomas Fire was the biggest fire recorded at the time and it was extremely close to UCSB. It almost happened again in November of 2019 with the Cave Fire, but thankfully that one was not as devastating. Due to the fire season becoming a year long thing, we are always at risk of another fire happening. Watching the film “Fire in Paradise” made me wonder if we are prepared to face an even more devastating fire than the ones that have already happened. I had no idea that Ventura County was ranked the fastest-warming county in the lowest 48 states. The warming of the ocean has already started to affect sea life, for example, an expansive kelp forest has been depleted and 13 whales have washed up on shore dead. If the fires don’t kill us first, then the death of sea animals will start to affect us.

Since I live in Santa Barbara, and I would go to the local farmer's market every week, I think the drought will affect me a lot sooner or later. I have seen more tropical fruit such as mango, dragon fruit, passion fruit in the market like Lazy Acer. The mango didn't taste as good as the one I brought in the original country. I guess the soil in Santa Barbara is not fit for such kinds of crops. 
 <br><br>

Although the La Paloma Ranch, once filled with water, now has very little water left because of the combination of drought and technology. Because of the high water intensity needed to grow avocado, a farmer has to switch to tropical crops like agave to make a profit. Still, they are not even sure if they can make money from it. Since farmers and ranchers have a 5 percent decline in revenue than last year, they might think of to raise their price for a product like avocado to gain more profit to live.
 <br><br>

I am also surprised that in Santa Barbara, the most significant contributor to air pollution and greenhouse emissions is the car. Before I read the article, and I didn't know the relationship between free parking and environmental pollution.
 <br><br>
From the article, the government didn't do enough to enforce their rule and make changes.  What worse is the oil industry still has the power to use "high intensive" operations such as fracking and steam injection. Such a contradiction still exists in the city council.

I was shocked to see that Ventura County has the highest warming temperatures compared to the rest of the lower 48 states. The warming has already passed the 2-degree Celsius threshold that the Paris Climate Accord set in place. As a result, Ventura County and neighboring areas have already experienced tragic fires as a result of this temperature rise. If Ventura’s temperature rise is exemplary at all of what the rest of the world will look like with the 2-degree rise, the climate crisis will definitely wreak havoc on earth, animals, and people. Many of the fires occurred in wealthy areas, showing that monetary wealth, success, and class, have absolutely nothing to do with who the climate crisis will affect, although they might be better able to deal with the effects brought upon them. Back home, multiple of my friends and acquaintances’ homes were destroyed by the Malibu fires as well as Ventura fires. Now, in Santa Barbara – my new home, the effects of climate change are still right in my backyard. Tenants and landowners of Del Playa Drive have to worry about their safety as well as real estate investments in the area as a result of sea level rise. It seems that wherever you go, the effects of climate change are right by your side. This is especially true in southern California, but unfortunately will likely be true for most of the world. The “global weirding” phenomenon is a new concept to me, but one that might become more apparent in the coming years. The fact that there was a tornado warning in southern California is insane, and shows just how little we know about what the real effects of the climate crisis might be.

This article sparked a number of reactions in me. I went from feeling sympathy to feeling angry to feeling sad. Being a college student here, I felt bad for not paying attention to the conditions of my second home until now. I knew about the disasters that have happened in the past few years but I was never invested into learning about the overall environmental conditions and their issues. However, after reading this article I realized the similarities between the role of this county and the role of our country as a whole. 
 <br><br>


I find it saddening and scary that life in Southern California is becoming unpredictable due to the natural disasters that are fueling this. In past years, people assumed that sea level rise was the biggest problem Santa Barbara county could face. However, this article really changes that thought. I learned that Santa Barbara county not only faces issues with flooding but also environmental destruction, and this is affecting farmers, their work and wildlife. This problem is largely due to the "changing natural world", as this article describes it, which is sad because nature is meant to be beautiful and peaceful but we are making it dangerous and deadly. 

 <br><br>

When Wilson explained the role that the changing environment plays in the work of ranchers and farmers, I did not know how to react. Yes, it angers me that wildlife is dying and that harvests are failing, leading to losses in revenue and having to accommodate their crops (which may not be as profitable) to the drier climate. However, I do not know what it is going to take for people and leaders here in Santa Barbara to realize the damage that is being done to the environment.

 <br><br>

I was surprised with the irony that this article explains: Santa Barbara was the birthplace of the modern environmental movement yet is doing nothing to reach its anti-pollution goals. Scott Wilson poses a question that activists are asking, "If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?". This question caught my attention because I related this to the role that the United States plays in the worldwide climate crisis. It is no surprise that the U.S. is a dominating force that is ignoring the climate crisis and its consequences, but I was not expecting this from Santa Barbara. Similar to the power and influence that the US has as a country, Santa Barbara has this as a county. It attracts hundreds of tourists because of what it is known for: beautiful scenery and warm climate. However, also similar to the US, instead of using this influence and popularity to educate surrounding counties and frequent visitors, Santa Barbara is not using this attention for anything other than profit and business. It is as if Santa Barbara was the county version of the United States because Wilson explains, "But the oil industry still has clout. In 2014, it spent big to defeat a county referendum that would have banned “high-intensive” drilling operations such as fracking and steam injection. And county officials are actively considering a proposal to allow a major drilling expansion in the north, a move environmentalists say would directly contradict their climate goals". This shows that similar to the US, Santa Barbara is simply interested in continuing to make money at the expense of its workers and environment rather than implementing change to save them.

As a native Californian, this article is heartbreaking to read. Understanding how climate change is directly affecting not only California in general, but Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and neighboring counties which I call home is truly alarming. I know that climate change is a very dangerous problem that we have to address, and seeing that my home is in danger sparks an emotional state that encourages other Californians like myself to begin to step up to this problem, as our home is growing more and more dangerous by the day. 
 <br><br>

Seeing the statistics of the changes in temperature was something that I was not aware of before reading this article. It is clear and obvious that LA and SB counties have gone up in temperature by 2 degrees celsius, and yet nothing seems to be happening to prevent and reverse these changes. On the contrary, the problem seems to only be getting worse, a 14% increase since 2007 to be exact. This is a problem, as it seems that people are either not educated enough, or simply do not care. The bright side of this, is that both problems can be improved upon, and change is actually not impossible.
 <br><br>

It truly is sad to see how fast the climate crisis is progressing. Living in California, I have sadly experienced these issues first-hand, particularly the wildfires and how much more of them there has been in recent memory. Things need to change as climate change and it’s problems are seen more and more every year.

Reading the article "2°C: Beyond the limit" was very interesting because of how personal it is. I lived through the 2007 fires in San Diego as well, and never thought about the possibility that the fire could have not been nearly as bad if it weren't for climate change. Like many other people are commenting, I think reading about a fire right here in Santa Barbara is making that little voice in your head telling you climate change is serious and you should do your part to do something about it, that much louder. I switched to an entirely plant based diet this week and I have been feeling great on it, not only because of the probable increased nutrient intake, but because I feel like I'm contributing to something bigger than myself every time I eat. Reading that, "unless conditions change, erosion could claim up to 78 percent of the city’s bluffside beaches by 2060" doesn't have to cause a stress or fear response if action is taken. I think many people don't like these types of classes, or hearing about pressing issues in the world if there is something they are doing to contribute to it. Rather than viewing these things as negatives, if we take more steps to reduce our carbon footprint, every time we hear about the horrors of climate change we can think "Yeah that's horrible, and I'm trying to do something about it" which feels extremely empowering. I look forward to hearing about other things americans can do,  specifically college students, to help save the planet.

I find the term "global weirding" to be an appropriate description of how unpredictable and concerning the effects of climate change is not only in Santa Barbara county, but throughout the state of California. The article "2°C: Beyond the limit” really highlights how quickly and unexpected climate change is affecting the west coast with rapidly increasing temperatures, loss of both urban and marine habitats, and hurricane alerts that are unheard of in this region of the U.S. 
 <br><br>


I think it's safe to assume that this article hit especially hard for those studying at UCSB as a large part of the article focuses on the impact of climate change in Santa Barbara county and how the consensus on environmental activism seems solid, but isn't resulting in any pragmatic change in how the local government approaches solutions. While I'm no Santa Barbara native, I feel somewhat responsible as a UCSB student to prioritize this global AND local issue and contribute to urging the county to take greenhouse gas emissions and potential life-threatening fires more seriously.

After reading the article “2 Degrees Celsius: Beyond The Limit”， I realize that people really should take some effective actions to save the earth or just the living place they are currently in. For most of people, 2 degrees Celsius may mean little for them, but impressive for the whole environment. Nearly all the things including human will be affected. I know it would cause the sea level raising and extreme weather. However, one thing I learn from the article is that the rate of the possible wildfires also increases because of the global warming. The California fire in 2017 made me shook for a while, and it was not only the one serious fire. It mostly happens every year. One reason is that according to the text, the global warming will result the low moisture in the coastal area, and more risk of fire. Once the fire and disaster are close or related to people, they will care and try to stop it. Clearly, from the context, the government is not even trying to make the environment better, they do not even try to fake the data to lie to people. They just do nothing about the environment which is sad for everyone who wants the government to give some plans to protect the environment.

Much like the prior week’s reading, the article “2 Degrees Beyond the Limit” really put the reality of climate change into perspective for me. I never really understood the severity of this issue until literally last week when I watched Before the Flood. It makes me so angry that I didn’t understand how serious it was, and it only took the mountains located 2 miles away to burst into flames for me to see the reality of the situation. 
 <br><br>

I supported climate change and understood that it was happening, but took it like it was a backhanded compliment. I wasn’t in denial whatsoever– I knew things were changing detrimentally, but I didn’t understand how far it had gone. My ignorance was so high that I would believe its repercussions were so far fetched into the future and wouldn’t come in my lifetime, when in reality, I was just really stupid and dumb. Now that Twitter acts like more than a news app than a social media tool, I slowly became updated with its detrimental effects (prior Santa Barbara fires, Australian wildfires, glaciers melting, etc.) and ‘advocated for change’– which basically just means retweeting every tweet I see about these natural disasters and hoping that someone with higher power or authority would see it. In actuality, I didn’t know how to help. I didn’t have the money to donate (I couldn’t even afford to pay for school), I don’t have a giant social media platform, and I literally know nothing about the scientific part of the issue. All I knew was that our world is going to hell from small clips on Twitter, of all places. I wanted to make a change, and still do, but I just don’t know how.
 <br><br>

This article not only put this dire situation into perspective for me, but also educated me on how its affecting my own backyard. Coming from an incredibly diverse town in NorCal (Stockton), moving to Santa Barbara was an entirely new experience for me– from the weather, to the environment, and especially the people, everything was uncharted territory. A major issue I did not see coming was that I didn’t expect to break out in hives two months after moving in because of a rapid moving bushfire only two miles away from campus. Although wildfires are mostly common for a state like California, the three most severe fires in state history have only happened in the past two years, according to the article. This fact is what shocked me the most– what have we done that we are now setting record-breaking recipes for disasters? What comes after is what is the most annoying; usually, when a disaster happens, it takes over social media and suddenly the victims are flooded with ‘prayers and thoughts’. What are prayers and thoughts going to do when your house is on fire? What is ‘sending love’ going to do to the thousands of people forced out of their homes melting glaciers? Is your repost to your Facebook feed with a sad face and broken heart emoji going to help reverse their trauma of everything they built burned to ashes? Everyone knows that these detrimental things are happening, but nobody is willing to change it. Either we stop this now, or we are going to make our lives a living hell– literally.

The article “2ºC: Beyond the limit” was shocking to me in the sense that nothing major began to show up in Santa Barbara County weather wise until 2016. It is a terrifying thought that natural disasters such as fires have become a semi-annual occurrence in California when they used to occur once every few years. In addition, the sizes of fires have drastically increased within the past decade to the point where “four of the five worst fire seasons of the past half century have burned in the last two decades.” When Scott Wilson mentioned the Thomas fire when discussing past fires in California, I was not shocked by the damage since I experienced aspects of that fire my freshman year here at UCSB. I believe that my feelings that came out of my experience with the Thomas fire at UCSB are similar to how environmental activists feel when seeing how little Santa Barbara county is doing to help our planet. During the Thomas fire, I felt terrified for my well being when seeing ash falling from the sky and creating a thin layer that covered the pathways around campus and receiving emails that stated that we were still required to go to our classes to finish week ten and finals week. These emails were often cushioned with comments about how the school officials really cared about our health and safety yet wanted us to travel across campus to our classes when the air quality index was in the very unhealthy section. To compare, the Santa Barbara County has created a Climate Action Plan that is meant to help keep us on track to reducing our gas emissions. The problem is that this Climate Action Plan has not been enforced in the slightest bit and the Santa Barbara county has actually increased it amount of gas emissions by almost the same percent we were supposed to reduce it by. Additionally, county officials have proposed a new wave of oil projects which will further increase our gas emissions. Just like UCSB in December 2017, Santa Barbara county officials express concerns about the safety of their people yet continue to ignore the problem in front of them and leave their population in danger.

I faced a similar situation that put the health of myself and those around me at risk when I was forced to continue going to school during the Holy Fire in Riverside County. I remember seeing my friends’ posts of snow-like ash covering their cars, videos of the fire up against their home back gates, and people walking around my high school’s campus with Home Depot dust masks. 
 <br><br>


Once again, in the article “2°C: Beyond the Limit” written by Scott Wilson, yet another example of greed and economic ventures prioritized before environmental consciousness is present. In the case of Santa Barbara, which Wilson describes to be the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, it can be assumed that the city would be setting a fine example for powerful environmental policy and initiatives.  I was alarmed to discover that the opposite was in fact true. Specifically, in 2015, the county pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent compared with 2007 levels while instead, two years later, a progress report found that greenhouse gas emissions actually increased by 14 percent. Unfortunately, it can be assumed these levels have increased since  2007 and are much higher in the present day. It’s truly difficult to think that if Santa Barbara, the city that gave rise to Earth Day and other environmental movements can’t set the example, what city really will be able to. 

 <br><br>

I firmly believe that comprehensive solutions to issues that propagate global climate change, such as rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions, lie in policy reform, commitment, and accountability which other major cities around the world such as Berlin and Copenhagen have implemented to become more sustainable.  I hope to see a carbon tax or strict cap-and-trade policies enforced by Santa Barbara city officials for local fossil fuel sources and businesses to cut down CO2 emissions.

Reading the article “2C Beyond the limit,” I was shocked to learn that Santa Barbara county has warmed up by 2.3 degrees Celsius and Venture by 2.6 degrees Celsius. This shocked me because I thought that Santa Barbara has been a cold and breezy place. Never could I have thought that Santa Barbara is warming up at such a high rate. What really caught my attention about this article was when it stated that “Thirteen whales washed ashore dead this year in San Francisco…and when marine biologist went searching for answers, they found that many of them had empty stomachs” That right there already makes me not only sad but angry at myself and the rest of the world who have been the cause of this. As I had mentioned before in other comments, I did not know much about the climate crisis and never really paid attention to articles or news explaining the consequences. But now that I learn more and more, I begin to realize that the issue is indeed huge and we can’t continue to kill these poor animals.
  <br><br>

Now why is it that Santa Barbara conduct a full inventory of its greenhouses once every 3 years? The consequences are already her, the fires happened and yet they don’t do nothing about it. People should be worried and more up to do something to avoid these disastrous events. But people are not willing sacrifice things for the wellbeing of everyone. Everyone is so adapted to the lifestyle they own today that they can’t see themselves changing it. We should keep everything that has happened in the past so that we can help change the future.

I agree with both of your points here. I grew up in the San Fransisco Bay Area for all my life before coming to Santa Barbara, so to read about both of these areas makes me feel resentful with not just our local governments for not having better climate crisis intentions but also for not doing its job of evaluating the cities' position in this crisis and not educating the public about what needs to be done. The article, “2ºC: Beyond the Limit"  mentions the current consequences we are facing in the SB/Ventura County like threats to bird species, kelp forests, marine life, fire seasons, IV cliffs eroding, agriculture crops, and drought. This list seems too extensive for me not to question why more action is not being taken. SB considering a "wave of new oil projects" in conjunction to our supposed climate action plan is incongruent. The article points out that we know climate change is coming, but we are not preparing for it. However, Ken points out in this video that there are a range of consequences that are not expected for some regions like tornadoes, drought and fire. That makes me think: when I prepare for climate disasters, I simply think of earthquakes because of where we live. However, if a tornado warning were to come about, I don't have a clue what to do. 
  <br><br>
This article and video open my eyes to understanding that we do have to talk more about how to slow/reverse our contributions to climate change, AND also talk about preparing for the worst and educating our public of the best way to do so. After reading, it seems like we are already in the worst of California's climate history and it doesn't seem like it is going to be reversed any time soon. If our government is too naive in realizing how the long-term change to something as small as free public parking downtown to allow us to keep our city and beaches beautiful and safe, then we have a long way to go.

Reading this article made me reconsider the way I see Santa Barbara. When I first arrived, the city seemed like an oasis that was sustainable and much more green than LA county. However, I failed to see that it was much like any other American city. There were big corporate interests that could find their way past any regulation or proposal, letting greed and profit overcome responsibility towards people's livelihoods and homes. It was surprising to me that the city officials still consider proposals from oil companies for drilling and fracking despite the city's goal towards more green practices and lifestyles. Another concerning issue discussed in the article was food security and how farming has become impacted. What the hell are we going to do with agave? Are avocados going to go extinct? These questions simmered in my mind while reading how not only homes were burning but our very food supply was being burned with them. I also feel for those who constantly have to fear another widespread fire. It is especially frightening considering that these wildfires have become a regular occurrence since I came to UCSB. There was the Woolsey Fire and the Cave Fire. One for each of my academic years here.

The article "2*C: Beyond the limit' was an interesting wake up call to me.  When I came to UCSB, I knew the campus was an idyllic place and the culture regarding climate change was very active.  Despite how much work UCSB has already contributed to fighting climate change, it has not been enough.  

  <br><br>

The fall of my freshman year, I was busy preparing for finals when the power went out.  I did not think much of it until a friend at Berkeley texted me to see if I was okay.  This was how I found out about the Thomas Fire.  Over the next week or two, I saw how powerless we were to control anything or affect the fire.  Despite the climate activism at UCSB and the surrounding area, we were not safe from the changing climate.  This article helped explain why, explaining how SB county is one of the highest temperature increases nationally.  2.3*C is already well above the worst case scenario the Paris Accord called for.
  <br><br>


The worst part is, the Thomas Fire was the beginning of a new norm.  Climate change is severely affecting our school and surrounding region, from the hills of Montecito to the erosion of Del Playa.    I have walked under those cliffs on the beach, and I am honestly stunned many of those houses are still inhabitable.  Unfortunately, it will probably take the collapse of a balcony/deck for many to wake up to the fact that these 'prime spots' in Isla Vista are no longer safe.

I likewise have noticed how prominent the climate change activism is at UCSB. Almost every day trying to walk from the library to campbell hall people are approaching with clipboards asking if you’ll help “save the turtles” or coral reefs. While spreading the word is important, I agree that not much is actually being done. 
  <br><br>
When I was sixteen, my house burned down in a wildfire… and this happened in the rainy state Washington. Coming to school in California was clearly not an optimal choice if my goal was to escape fires. Kevin points out that fires, like the Thomas Fire, are the new norm: a sad but true reality. 
  <br><br>
The article gave insight into other devastating effects of climate change. Whales washing up on shorelines in San Francisco with empty stomachs is something that never even crossed my mind as a possibility. The article laid out clear statistics to emphasize how dire our current situation is and how change is needed.

The article “2ºC: Beyond the limit” was greatly impacting to me on how climate change has affected areas I am familiar with.  Many people choose to ignore the reality of global warming and climate change because it does not directly have an effect on them.  For a very wealthy area to have been affected, Montecito, CA, is eye-opening because people with fewer resources could struggle more in this crisis.  Climate change is a real issue and hopefully, people can understand the desperate need for change we need to make in our day to day lives to better the circumstances that we are in.  I hope that it does not take more tragedies to occur for people to become aware of the dangerous reality of climate change.

That is exactly what I feel about this article and Ken's video. And I think it did a great job in helping people feel sympathetic about this problem. We should care more about this issue because we do need to make a difference in order to protect our beloved homes.

I did no research about this school when I was entering as a freshman, it was the only UC that accepted me so I happily enrolled. As I was driving down the coast during move in day my mom told me that I was lucky that I was going to live in such a beautiful place, without knowing any of Santa Barbara's history. Few weeks into school I decided to go to the beach with my friends and there was tar under our feet and some old dude told us that was normal so we shrugged it off. I haven't been in this school for more than two years and there were already two fires: this place is far from normal! In the article "2 degrees Celsius: beyond the limit" I learned that Santa Barbara is like your basic hypocrite, it only cares about how it looks to others by saying one thing and doing the other. Santa Barbara can fool people like my parents however truth is, it’s not beautiful at all. How can SB county claim to be protecting the environment when all they care about is how much parking space they have for an expanding population? It’s no wonder that the average temperature has increased by 2.3 degrees celsius, their largest contributors are from cars. It angers me that SB says they have a climate action plan, yet there are no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals. They even thought of allowing oil companies to continue drilling even though 3 million gallons of oil was spilled in 1869, which explains why there was tar under my feet. I wasn’t shocked to read that by 2060 most of Del Playa would be eroded because a rock almost fell on me when I was laying on the beach. I don’t know about you guys but I’m ready for some actual changes.

I went to school in LA before. The influence of SB was a beautiful town with beautiful environment. When I came here, the school also had many activities to protect the environment. I have a new perspective on the environment, and the statement in this article shocked me, mentioning that in 2015, the county promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% compared to 2007 levels. Two years later, a progress report found that Santa Barbara did not reduce emissions, in fact it was 14% higher than in 2007. The fact that the interest has slowed down the process of protecting our environment, these facts made me realize that the environment is still an issue we need to pay attention to. I like the beautiful environment of SB is not like seeing it worsening. Actively make the greatest efforts for climate change and participate in environmental protection activities

I have had the similar experiences to you while attending UCSB. Ever since I toured this school in 2016, I knew I wanted to come here. Going to a school basically on the beach was surreal to me. My parents said the same thing to me, that I was so lucky to live my undergraduate career in such a beautiful place. I did not see anything wrong with the Santa Barbara until I started actually living here. Upperclassmen would constantly tell me about the Thomas Fire and how much of a negative impact it had on the students of UCSB. Students had to wait to take their finals after Winter Break because the fire was so detrimental. They would also warn me about the tar on the beaches, eroding rock, and high sea levels. During my time at UCSB, I have seen a decrease in the amount of people that go to the beach because of these negative consequences of the climate crisis. Since then, the Cave Fire occurred during the time I planned on going home for Thanksgiving Break. I almost did not go home because of the fact that it was also raining that day and I was frightened of the mud slides that might have occurred. I do not want to live in a place/world where I have to fear living my everyday life because of these natural disasters that are due to climate change. I also do not want to come back to UCSB in my adulthood, only to see that Del Playa is no longer a street in Isla Vista. We need to figure out a serious solution that will change the course that the climate crisis is taking us towards.
<br><hr>
I relate to your experience so much! When I was driving down here with my parents for the first time, I was in awe of the beauty of this city - it looked like a tropical island out of some travel brochure. And growing up mainly in Los Angeles and Orange County - very urbanized parts of California - the UCSB area seemed so natural and refreshing. Despite going to school here for almost 1.5 years, it never occurred to me that climate change was impacting this beautiful city - the oceans were sparkling blue, there were trees everywhere, skies were clear, and you could tell that the air you were breathing was super clean. I assume my lack of familiarity with Ventura and Santa Barbara County prevented me from being able to notice changes in the climate, because reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the Limit" really showed me how wrong I was about everything. Now, since 2016, Santa Barbara has had two wildfires. Temperatures here and in Ventura are rising alarmingly. 
<br><br>

One of the most saddening parts was seeing how actions of big companies affect the poorer communities. Every time I travel between home and Santa Barbara, I always see farmers working in the fields along the highway, and it is upsetting knowing that they will be largely impacted as the climate changes and begins to affect their crops, forcing them to plant new things - things they are unfamiliar with, and things which won't bring them as much money.
<br><br>

Also, it's funny how the article mentions that the people of Santa Barbara tend to be climate activists, yet we are far behind the plan of preventing climate change from taking over. We are kind of like the United States in that sense - a country that should be ahead of everyone in facing this threat but isn't. Instead we are using fossil fuels and contributing to rising levels of CO2 way more than other places - and as always the poor and unaffiliated have to suffer.
<br><hr>
I can feel you! I went to high school in Minnesota, a state covered by snow for most time in a year, so I had never experienced the environmental issues talked in the article before I came to Santa Barbara. My parents are the type of people who have never been to California but love it because of the movie or TV shows they had watched before. When I told them that I decided to go to UCSB last April,  they were so happy and said that I picked a good place to study and live in. However,  their mind got changed by the fire in last quarter. They were upset and worried about me a lot since they don’t really know how severe the fire was or if their daughter was safe or not. Especially when my friends who go to UCLA or UCB got school canceled due to the fire, my parents’ anxieties looked got on to another level. I felt bad for making them worry about me every single day during that time, and I feel like that the government must start to do something necessary for saving Santa Barbara.
<br><hr>
Similar experience of choosing the school. Many of my friends thought UCSB is a paradise since it is near the sea. I came to this school without visiting, attending orientation, or even doing the research online. So before I came, I deeply believed that UCSB is extremely beautiful. I was even dreaming about I study near the sea. However, the fact astonishes me. What I saw is sand and soil that exposed from the limited plants. I can't believe this is the place that people called it "paradise". I've studied in LA for two years. I understand SB is a small city, which might not develop as good as LA. I have to say that LA is a place full of buildings, so the plants are limited which I understand. However, I can't believe that SB has even fewer plants than LA. I lived in Santa Catalina, and I always joke with my friends that we can have many airplanes in front of our dorm since there is a vast tract of land without anything on it. Besides that, during FYI, the staff told us that there will be tar stick to your feet if you going to the beach. I still remembered that the staff said: "don't be scared, it is normal". The SB people even thought tar is the specialty of SB's beach. People treat this weird thing as normal without thinking about the reason. I believe this is also the reason why oil companies are continuing drilling while ignoring the spilled oil.

Professor said central California is the Mediterranean Climate. And ancient people even said this is a pleasant place. However, when I first came to LA, I thought it is a tropical desert climate. In my memory, Central California's morning, noon, and evening temperatures are like different seasons. Now, I realize that this is not due to the Climate Types, but human actions.
<br><hr>
In moving to UCSB for school, myself and my parents also fell for the ‘beautiful school by the beach’ mentality that seems to be what attracts most people to this institution. While this is somewhat true, in that it is very visually pretty here, that facade of niceness is quickly slipping into the ocean. I’ve only been here since September and I’ve already left once because of a wildfire. Coming from Boston, I had expected California wildfires to exist but they were still a somewhat abstract natural disaster event. I hadn’t necessarily expected these events to have direct impacts within a place that claims to be at the forefront of the climate movement. It may be different from the severe blizzards and hurricanes back home, but both places are indicative of the climate crisis and the consequences we face as a result.

<br><hr>
I agree, but I am hardly surprised by the lack of action. I do not know how many climate change deniers there are, but I do know that there are probably an equal number (if not more) people who acknowledge climate change yet do not feel individually responsible to change their way of life. Coming from NYC, I never learned to drive, there was never a need for me to learn and I don't think it really struck me how much cars are part of people's daily life until I moved to California. A lot of my friends say that they miss their cars and that they feel as though they don't have as much freedom without it. This is all understandable in a place with such a prevalent car culture, yet when I told them how big the car problem was, they shrugged. This article really showed that it takes a disaster for people to want to mobilize, to be willing to step out of their comfort zones and change their way of life in order to save it. 

<br><br>

As an ES major I’m disappointed in SB for their lack of initiative and being “all talk.” Driving through California when looking at schools I saw big farms and dried out or polluted lakes and a desert that stretched on and on and on. It’s scary to think that UCSB might look completely different in 20 years, but it’s scarier to think about the scale of the next disaster that will motivate people to demand action. How close do the fires need to get to stop bending towards the interests of oil industries? How many people need to lose homes or lives to understand how bad it really is?
<br><hr>
I came from the Central Valley of CA where much of the food is produced for the United States like Ken states in the video. Food production, like everything, comes with costs. These costs include pesticides and harmful gases. We have such a high methane production due to the dairy farms, it is dry, and a lot of smog settles in the valley because of our geography. Our summers are over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Our people have asthma due to the terrible air quality. We are like a bowl of climate catastrophe. I thought, like you, that coming to Santa Barbara I would be better off. I too was astonished to find out that Santa Barbara county is being impacted more by climate change and oil pollution than any other county. The evidence is right in front of us, yet we are still slow to act and that is sad. Many UCSB student don’t even bring cars to campus and we bike everywhere, yet we will witness some of our homes on DP fall off the cliffs. I have come to think of this place as home and I don’t want it to fall apart. I side with you in facilitating change but we need to get the adults on our side as well.
<br><hr>
I was honestly angered by the article when it discussed the situation of free parking in Santa Barbara. I think it's a great thing that we get when we go downtown and are able to park our cars freely. But it is a luxury. When I thought about how we only have one highway going through our area, I thought, ok, fair. We need cars to get to and from this area. People live far away and there aren't very economic methods of doing so. However, what was infuriating to me was the fact that yes, there is a need for cars here, but the abuse of them is insane. Biking or skateboarding to class is the fastest and certainly cheapest way to get to class and yet there is still an overwhelming number of students who will drive to their class with no regard to the impact that it has in already one of the most climate affected areas in the continental US. Little things like biking or walking are tiny things that we can do to lower our own carbon footprint where it is exceedingly important.
<br><hr>
I grew up in Carpinteria, just South of here.  I have memories of being a little kid and going to the beach down by the tar pits, and getting tar all over our feet.  Then when we would get home, we would have to use gasoline or mayonnaise to get the tar off.  It became a weirdly nostalgic memory for me when I moved to San Diego and have lived most of my life in SD.  As I grew older though, we would come back to visit SB county, and I realized the reasoning for the tar on the beaches.  It disgusted me.  This article confirmed what I have come to realize, and as you put it so well, that “Santa Barbara is a hypocrite.”  I think a lot of California pretends to be such an environmentally friendly place, but I was shocked to find out the truth behind it. I attended the Climate Crisis Rally about a month back, and that is when I, personally was presented with the numbers of temperature rise for SB and Ventura counties, and I was surprised that my newfound home was a primary source of warming in the US.   I think you are right to be angry, and I share your anger.  I too, have noticed the erosion occurring along DP, and have heard stories of students getting too close to the cliffs and falling to death.  I too am ready for change.

<br><hr>
I agree with many of the points you brought up. I found this article to be incredibly informative on both climate change as an issue and our flawed ways in which we combat it. When I first moved to Santa Barbara last quarter, I was under the impression that we are a very environmentally conscious community as well, considering many aspects of the environmentalist movement originated Santa Barbara. I was disappointed to see the ways described in the article in which SB has fallen short in regards to making progress towards a more green city. I was surprised to hear about the climate action plan having no actual regulations to hold businesses or individuals accountable. It is still upsetting to me that we, as a society, refuse to give up certain aspects of our lifestyle for the benefit of our environment. At the rate in which the climate is changing, it is not possible for us to put off making real change. We should take note from other more environmentally friendly cities, and strive for legitimate progress instead of putting on a guise of an environmentalist community without any actual change being made.

I can definitely relate to buying into the facade of UCSB. Coming from Oahu, a warm, sunny, beach-oriented environment, I was expecting an easy transition to UCSB. All my friends told me how lucky I was to be going somewhere warm with beaches. Turns out UCSB is far from a paradise. It is sometimes warm but very dry which I used to like coming from a very sweaty, muggy climate back home. However, dryness is a major contributor to these wildfires, I have become fearful of how dry it is here because now I am aware of how this connects to the high probability of fires in SB. The beaches are also nothing that I have seen before. Beaches in SB are very narrow, brown, and high tide for most of the day. If you step into the water there's a pretty high chance that you will get brown tar stuck on your feet  s a result from a massive oil spill that occurred in 1969. I could barely go to the beach at all for the past 1.5 years because the tide is always extremely high. I know that the tide rises twice a day, but it seems as though the tide was high for the entire day in SB. After taking oceanography, I have learned that the narrowing of the beach comes from rising sea level and leads to erosion. This erosion is what is causing apartment complexes to shut down due to unsafe conditions. It is sad to think that if I visit SB in the future, IV may be dramatically reduced by erosion.
<br><hr>
This response is something i feel that most people experience when they actually live in Santa Barbara for quite some time. I've had a similar experience with the tar and its quite well... something. It's interesting how you brought up other peoples perceptions of Santa Barbara. Its commonly thought to be a consistently sunny, glamorous beach, and over all, a beautiful place. While i believe that to be true in the past, like many other places, it has been going through changes in its weather and ecosystems (arguably for worse). Climate change should be taken literally. Places like Santa Barbara, my home town or even your hometown will become something different towards the course of our lifetime. This type of change should be happening of a series of lifetimes and not in years. Imagine 50 years from now when you tell someone you lived in California, yet their only response is "oh that dry deserted fire hazard," when in your lifetime it was once considered one of the most beautiful places to live.
<br><hr>
When I visited UCSB last spring, at around the time to decide which school I wanted to go to, I was astonished to see how perfect the weather here was. Going to a school where the environment would be sunny days, beautiful beaches, and living in an overall paradise had me sold on wanting to come here.  But after taking on the beach getting tar on my shoes, seeing the erosion that is chipping away at DP day by day and witnessing the intense blaze that happened winter quarter 2019 this school has opened my eyes to how climate change is affecting all of us now.
<br><hr>
I think UCSB does advertise the campus and beaches a beautiful place. Yet they do not mention the fact that there is tar in the beach frequently which I saw first hand on my second trip to the beach. They also do not tell you the frequent  fires that have occurred in Santa Barbara. I had heard about the mudslides before because of news reports, but was not something that was on my mind until I saw the warning signs around Santa Barbara. I think since Santa Barbara county is thought of as a green friendly place they should own up to that image by really taking a stand and  place restricter regulations for businesses that contribute to the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I have a similar experience as you when I came to UCSB. I grew up near the Santa Monica Beach, and I thought UCSB would have a beautiful environment with sparkling oceans. After all, that's what my friends, family, and even media told me. Like you, I was surprised to discover tar when I stepped onto the beach here the first time. I am just a freshman so I haven't spent much time here yet, but I've already heard a lot about the environmental issues that surround Santa Barbara thanks to the previous English 22 class and even a history class! I agree with you when you said that Santa Barbara is visually pleasing, but is deceptive on its stance on environmental issues. It's frustrating that the Santa Barbara county officials only care about making SB "beautiful" so it can attract tourists or unwitting students like me. Even though there was a massive oil spill years ago, the SB county officials still allow oil rigs to be built despite massive opposition from their citizens. When the article said that erosion could claim up to 78 percent of Santa Barbara's cliffside beaches by 2060, I found it even more frustrating due to SB county officials' inactions. I really hope that we take action to curb climate change soon, or the water level will rise higher and higher until it claims more land. Not only that, but the temperatures will rise too, which affects animals and the environment.
<br><hr>


It’s funny to think how many of us were sold this idea that Santa Barbara was just this happy little paradise stored away next to the beach away from droughts, earthquakes, and now fires (You know the usual stories you hear about California). I guess we all fell into our own sense of allusion that climate change would hit differently here, and it did but not what we all imagined. I also had my encounter with the tar at the beach. I was a part of the EOP STEP program this summer. We had a beach day to which everyone was siked about because you know beach school. So you have all these incoming freshman and RAs marching down from the Santa Cruz dorms down towards the beach, a beautiful sight really. It wasn’t until I was hanging out with friends and an RA that we were informed about the tar. The RA told us there had been an oil spill from a refinery higher up the coast and that ever since there’s been tar in the waters. She told us to take a good look at the souls of our feet and sure enough that icky black stuff was there. She continued to inform us the best way to get it off is to use baby oil. She recounted a memory of seeing a girl come out of the water with a large tar build up on her swimsuit, serious stuff right there told in a very nonchalant way. I asked her if the school had done anything in response, like a potential lawsuit against the company of the oil refinery. Unfortunately no, well that she knows of but students, especially the environmental studies department, were very angry and protested but that’s all I know.  I’m over here high key pissed because this is a huge influential institution we are talking about, UCSB is situated in such an affluent part of California you’d think there would be more mobilization. I remember the conversation about this died off and that was that. Then towards the start of the quarter, waves of crude smelling winds blew through the dorms; essentially stinking up our whole floor, it smelled like freshly paved roads. Our floors became concerned and our RA was contacted, to which she informed us it was the smell from the oil refineries nearby. Umm ok like that’s a normal thing to be smelling and get used to. We all went back to doing homework or whatever and that was the end of that. Do you ever notice how many of these oil drilling platforms there are? A crap ton, just look out your window when you are driving through the freeway, they are lined up neatly one after the other. Makes you wonder just how much are they pumping out daily and how much money are these companies making and are willing to negotiate in order to keep themselves afloat. Well, there has been movement, just back in October Platform Holly was finally shut down and this only means offshore drilling will soon receive more hits. Good news right and like Ken has already established this Climate Crisis issues falls mostly on us so in many ways we as UCSB should lead and act on the empty words of politicians and corporations.
<br><hr>
For starters, I was in the same boat as you were: UCSB was the only UC that did not weight-list me and instead of looking into the school prior, I instantly accepted due to the same reason as you. I, too, did not know the history of Santa Barbara especially about the climate history. When I first came to UCSB for orientation and went to the beach for the first time, I noticed that the ocean was not as clean as I expected it to be. I also noticed the tar in the water as well as the sand, which really caught my eye simply because the beaches I have been to were not the same as the Goleta beach. Another unexpected factor that I have experienced this year (my first year) that I am not used to was the fire that happened in November. Just from those two factors, I also realized that the school; as well as the city in general, was not as normal as I thought it would. My initial response to the acceptance of UCSB was "Wow, I got into such a beautiful school"; although, once I finally visited the campus, it was not as beautiful as I thought it would be in person--I got over the campus the first week I was here already. The fire that occurred during November was quite shocking for me, but now makes more sense with the fact that the average temperature has increased by 2.3 degrees Celsius since 1985. If the temperature continues to increase as time goes by, the average number of fires around this area will also increase and will make a major impact in the city as a whole. I agree as a whole with your statement that action that will actually help must be done as soon as possible. The fact that the SB/Ventura area even getting a tornado warning is extremely scary to even think about in California, especially since you do not often hear about tornadoes occurring here. We definitely need to pay more attention on the environment we live in.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with every point of your argument. When I first went to the beach in IV I was in shock by the condition it was in. Santa Barbara County needs to take better care of this beautiful space because it is being deteriorated and torn apart by its inhabitants. So many people come to UCSB because of its location yet everyone refuses to take care of it. Regulations must be implemented to preserve this county and also surrounding locations.

Ever since the Thomas Fire, whenever there are fears of any natural disaster, twitter blows up with UCSB students making jokes about what natural disaster will occur this time. The truth is that for the past years we have been living in the middle of all of these climate changes which have created natural disasters that we have no idea about. This reading gave me a lot of context about what is happening around us. These natural disasters need to be taken more seriously by everyone and most importantly the SB county. I agree with you that Santa Barbara and UCSB really puts up a facade but it is really not as beautiful as it may seem. Even with the affects of the fires, UCSB wasn't put on any serious warning even while the fire was relatively close and the air quality was terrible. I am truly afraid of the situations we have had to deal with because evacuating from your school is not something you expect of may necessarily know how to deal with. While UCSB was not evacuated, I did not take my chances and left while things were not as bad as they became with the worsening air quality. I am also afraid for the changes that will occur in Santa Barbara after I am gone. It saddens me that DP and how we see UCSB now will not exists forever all due the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I also had a similar experience in terms of how I depicted the school before actually living here. I come from a small city in Southern California and one of the features it's most known for is its lake. However, if you were to ask any resident of the city about the lake they would probably advise you not to swim in it. If you were to visit what you would find is a body of dark green water and dead fish. Reason being that the lake consists of toxic algae and has even been closed various times due to the harmful levels of toxins that are related to it. This is something that's never really been fixed and I always assumed that it was because the city didn't have enough money to do so. 
<br><br>
Once it was time for me to move to Santa Barbara I assumed that it being a wealthy city and having a school that is very focused on environmental science that everything would be pretty clean and environmentally friendly. However, after becoming more familiar with the city and especially after reading this article I've come to realize that the measures that cities take in relation to how they deal with environmental issues ultimately has very little to do with the amount of money the city possesses. Santa Barbara has the money to do something about it but chooses not to because the city would rather spend it elsewhere. One of the quotes I found most compelling in the article was " we're always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and will cost something". Santa Barbara presents itself to be a city that is environmentally conscious yet won't take the steps needed to try to preserve its natural habitats.
<br><hr>
It is infuriating to realize that Santa Barbara does not actually enact what they promote. The city of Santa Barbara says they see themselves as leaders in the environmental movement, but not enough has been done since the oil spill that occurred in 1969. The city is currently focusing on expanding parking instead of implementing more bike paths to reduce the need for cars or improving public transportation. It is also interesting to consider how much the climate crisis is currently impacting us locally in Del Playa. The images shown in the article aren't shocking to see because we regularly see them when we're on the beach or any beach that has homes on the cliffs above.
<br><hr>
Like many of my peers, I chose to attend UCSB for its unique environmental surroundings.  It's not everyday you get the opportunity to attend a beautiful school between the beach and the mountains.  It deeply saddens me to hear the place I've come to love and call home is subject to so many dangerous climate changes that would make Santa Barbara unrecognizable.  I agree with the notion that Santa Barbara is not concerned with developing the right plan for environmental change.  The weather we experience is some of the best in the world and the fact we may face tornado storms is exceptionally unsettling and unusual.  California's reputation for frequent fires and droughts is not one lost on Santa Barbara and its surrounding counties and has been increasing in recent years.  Our climate should not be changing by these drastic amounts; there needs to be more direct and active changes made to protect our environment.  Just because we haven't felt the full effects of climate change like other places in the world, does not mean we won't in the very near future.

I only live an hour north from here, UCSB, so I’m pretty familiar with this area. Similar to most of these responses, I’ve always seen this area as beautiful and as the ideal place to live in, considering how housing is so expensive here. But after reading this article, I can see that is not the case since drastic changes in temperatures have caused damage to the region and affected the lives of everyone who lives here. I never really regarded the fires around here as something really serious, since it wasn’t uncommon for them to pop up in the local news but now I’m a bit more alarmed since I know the actual severity of them. These wildfires have claimed lives and caused property damage and it’s due to the rising temperatures in the region brought on by the climate crisis and by our lack of response to it. It was upsetting to read how Santa Barbara seems to care more about keeping its touristy vibes and image rather than putting into practice what they claim they will do to help the environment. Instead, they normalized the tar on the beaches and did the opposite of what they claimed they were going to do, they actually raised their greenhouse gas emissions by 14% instead of lowering them.

What I liked and hated most about this article because that the information directly affected my everyday life.  It was a reality check that climate change is no longer a distant concern, it is right here in our backyards. Living in such an environmentally friendly state, county, and town, it is easy to live everyday with more comfort in the fact that there are people out there making a difference and we may have a shot at cleaning up the mess that our parents and our parents parents made.  But alas, the ice caps are still melting at an alarming rate and California’s fire season has instead transformed the state into a year-round fire pit and still, there are not many signs of it slowing down anytime soon.  This is what I love and hate about this article-- or mostly this major.  You see so much hope in the young eyes that surround you, while repeatedly getting bombarded with a million reasons to abandon it all.  You want to be a part of the solution, while also trying to come to terms with the fact that the average American is four times richer than the average Costa Rican but they have figured out a way to get 98% of their energy from sustainable, hydroelectric power.  
<br><br>

The quote that ended up resonating with me the most was, “If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?” (Wilson, 2019).  This quote hits me so hard because I know that this is the most eco-friendly town that I have ever been in and if our efforts are still not making a big enough impact, we’re screwed.

I agree with this post as it made me feel extremely sad about our future, and honestly nostalgic about my time in IV even before I graduate. To think (and basically know) that the first house I lived in with my friends will not be sitting on DP in the next 30-50 years breaks my heart. I feel as if the reality that climate change is now directly affecting us instead of being a depressing news headline from a foreign nation experiencing drought/flood/fire is a huge wake up call. Though it is awful to experience this environmental degradation so close to home, it may be the only way for people to actually wake up and make a change as fast as we can. 
<br><br>


It is interesting to see how Santa Barbara, or particularly IV balances helping the environment. For example, most students recycle their single use to-go cups, or compost the biodegradable(ish) ones offered at places like Caje, which is absolutely amazing but then also buy single-use Puff's daily, which will just be added to the landfills or end up in the streets along with other random trash. We are so passionate about these things, yet mindlessly contribute in many ways. Though we make an effort more than most other age groups, or schools even, we have much to change.

After reading the article "2 degrees beyond the limit", I have to admit that the urgent fire happened about two months ago truly reminded us of our capricious climate, although I did not try to learn about the cause of that fire I was curious about the possibility of the fire. The first thing that came to my mind was rising temperature, mentioned in this article, I knew that higher temperature is always companied by loss of moisture, and then death of many trees and animals. It is frightening. This fire did stimulate leaders and residents to think about ways to mitigate climate change but no promises and imaginations came true because of consideration of government's or business men's own profit. But according to different kinds of scientific searches, we have to introspect ourselves and make an effort to minimize consequences of climate change including rising sea, more risk of fire, etc. We are supposed to achieve that goal of "average warming should be held within well below 2 degrees Celsius".

After reading the article, I got a better understanding of the influences of climate change. Just as Ken said in the video, most people would think about sea-level rise when it comes to global warming. However, now I know it's not just about sea-level, there are also many other issues happened around the world regarding the climate problem. The reading talks about the wildfire in Santa Barbara. Even though I didn't evacuate before, I still remember that day when I walked out of my apartment, I can smell the smoke in the air, which made me feel very uncomfortable. Also, I can feel the temperature is rising in my hometown. My hometown is known for the coolness in summer. But in recent years, I can feel it's not cool anymore. The temperature is about 30 degrees Celcius,  which rarely happened before. I think global warming is beginning to show the influence around the world, and it will only become worse if people don't take action about it.

In Scott Wilson’s article “2 C: Beyond the Limit” he describes the multitude of issues relating to the climate crisis that are apparent in Santa Barbara. Events such as forest fires, cliff erosion, and rising temperature signify significant changes within the recent years. I can relate to many of these changes because in the fall of 2018, me, my family, and friends had to evacuate our homes because of the Woolsey fires. I remember my parents frantically packing some of our most valuable items before we evacuated just in case our house burned down. Thankfully, our house didn’t burn down, but I can still remember the smell of ash in my entire city and inside my house, and our backyard all black from the ash and the hill right outside my house without any more plants because they had all burned down. It is frightening that climate change is happening right now, but still so many are ignorant to it and aren’t doing anything about it. Having been affected by a forest fire and living in Santa Barbara right now, this article makes me very aware of the immediate action we need.
<br><br>


I realized that many other people may not be as motivated to act because they have not actually experienced or been affected by climate change. I understand their lack of motivation, but we should keep informing people about the threats to gather more support and actually make change happen. Though I needed to be affected by a fire to become more proactive about this issue, it still made me realize the threat and how this crisis is not coming soon, but rather that it is already here.

I read your explanation about how you and your family had to evacuate your homes because of the fires. I remember back then, driving with my friend on the freeway seeing the fires and smoke in the distance. I tried to put myself into the shoes of the people living there, the ones in immediate danger and having to flee for their lives, and it was just unfathomable to me how their lives must have been shaken up. I fortunately live in an area that so far has not been directly affected by the fires in recent years. However, with the effects of climate change being noticed and felt everywhere, even in Santa Barbara as the article and Ken’s lecture explains, I am not so optimistic for the future of my hometown area. If tornadoes can form in Santa Barbara, then even worse wildfires can definitely pop up and spread to other, previously unaffected areas of southern California. 
<br><br>

I think that’s one of the many truly scary things about the climate crisis: no matter what horrible thing happens, it is never unfathomable for things to get even worse, even more destructive and disastrous in the future. 
<br><br>

I agree with your thoughts about how most people don’t feel motivated to take action until they themselves are directly affected by climate change. I agree with you because it accurately describes myself, as ashamed as I am to admit it. I am well aware of the horror and danger posed by the climate crisis, yet so far I can not say that I have taken any meaningful action myself. I feel guilty; it’s hard to change up the way you live. I have hope that by the end of this class I will have found the resolve to finally do something tangible in my life to help out, however small the effect may be.

The reading "2ºC: Beyond the limit" is really impressive. Although I knew that global warming is now affecting us, I have no idea it has already reached and influencing our backyard. I remember the fire that happened last November before Thanksgiving, we were able to see the fierce fire spreading at an extremely fast speed. I did think it's a spectacle, but I was also worried about it since it was too close to us. Another thing that the article explained is the cliff erosion in Isla Vista. I took an oceanic class last quarter, and I had the opportunity to do some field researches at Campus Point. I saw the exact same scene as the picture showed in the article. A portion of the base of coastal houses are high up in the sky supported by some concrete pillars. It is a really horrible thing as you have no idea when those houses will be no longer habitable.

According to the reading, Scott Wilson pointed out that something weird has happened in Southern California, which is the climate grows hotter and drier, and the wildfires take place more frequently. Also, the average temperature of many regions in California, like Ventura and Santa Barbara, has increased over 2 degrees Celsius which violates the Paris Agreement, which is average warming worldwide should be held below 2 degrees Celsius. Moreover, the rise in temperature results in drought which threatens the iconic coastal redwood forests, and bird populations have declined rapidly. Furthermore, many animals that live in the ocean are threatened because of the rising temperature. In addition, the marine layer is also diminishing since climate change has made the air more drought. Moreover, many residents are forced to evacuation many times in the last few years which is never happened in the past. The wildfires have happened so frequently that residents are complaining that they have to pack up and leave their house many times and experience life without electricity during the time wildfire takes place. Last but not least, climate change may lead to extreme weather. 
   <br><br>
  I did not believe climate change exists at first, but after I seeing the wildfire took place in Santa Barbara in 2019, I think it might be true. I believe that people begin to be aware of climate change because they can feel the change happened, and I also believe it is not too late to take action to mitigate climate change. Although Trump has announced that US quitted from the Paris Climate Agreement, the problem will be solved if people make efforts to reduce the CO2 emission and use renewable energy.

I think this article is especially influential to UCSB students. I remember that last year, we talked about “Virgil” and mentioned the term “environmental consciousness ” which means that people only know the importance of something when they lost it. The article mentioned how beautiful sceneries will gradually lose if the temperature keeps increasing. I am an international student who has heard the beauty of Santa Barbara long ago, so when I got here the thing that I do every day is to go to the cliff and watch the sea. However, this year, there is a yellow line there to show that there was a landslide. The article also mentioned the landslide, so I fall into a sad mood because that cliff is the place I go every day. Maybe one day in the future, that cliff will disappear and people will never be able to enjoy the stunning view of the sea from that cliff. Just as Das Williams said, my favorite sentence from the article and the one that I feel most related to,  “Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world—something important but remote. Now, I’m confronted with the fact we had a mass casualty event that was climate enhanced,” When I realize that I am about to lose something, I feel the stress and the urgency of solving environmental problems.

When reading the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit” I was surprised by how much the effects of climate change are present in areas near me. I thought that we must act now to prevent such things from occuring decades from now, but to see such changes already is frightening. I had some skepticism about the extent of warming in Ventura county that the article describes. I then realized that I have been feeling the effects of climate change and had simply been ignoring it. My mother often spoke of both a great loss in the population of birds and increasingly warmer winters in her 16 years in Ventura county. As recently as freshman year I remember having to bundle up whenever it got around the time of winter. My senior year I could have gotten away with a long sleeve most of the time. My family has also had at least 4 warnings to prepare for evacuation because of fires, and all of these scares have been within my last two years of high school. My family has been lucky enough to not even have to evacuate, but other people have not been as fortunate.

I agree that it is extremely scary and shocking how quickly California, particularly SoCal is heating up. Climate change is contributing to noticeable changes to our local environment. It is truly frightening that Ventura County is the fastest-warning county in the lower 48 states. Thank goodness your family wasn’t forced to evacuate. I can relate to worrying about my family, as my family lived extremely close to a major fire last year. Many nearby homes were destroyed and families were being evacuated. Luckily my parents did not get evacuated and were unharmed. But, with the climate crisis continuing to worsen, I’m scared our lucky streak may end.

I have lived in California my entire life, and I have never experienced any wildfires or mudslides however, my first quarter here at UCSB I witness my first wildfire. Never seeing a fire, I was obviously a bit scared because I have never been put into that situation. The Santa Barbara county is my home from home, so it worries me that not too long ago there was a mudslide where many people were dragged to shore, and that there have been frequent fires year after year. I fear that because the Santa Barbara County is warming up very quickly, these fires will only get worse year after year. I wonder how much longer we have until a fire, mudslide, or another natural disaster destroys us all. After reading “2 degrees beyond the limit”, I find it hypocritical that the county of Santa Barbara pledged to reduce greenhouse emissions by 15% and then two years later it was found out that instead of reducing those emissions Santa Barbara was actually exceeding it by 14%. It seems as if they literally do not care. It is crazy to see how climate change is already affecting us, cliffs on Del Playa drive are already disappearing due to the rising seal levels. So what other “natural disasters” does Santa Barbara have to encounter to actually do something and regulate the amount of greenhouse gasses being emitted.

Similarly, I have always lived in California my whole life and never had experienced any type of fires, mudslides, tornadoes, etc. In fall of 2017 when the Thomas fired occurred, I was so dumbfounded on how badly disasters like these impact the lives of people. Yes, as a student at UCSB I was frightened and just wanted to go back home to LA, but I could only imagine how the families in IV, Goleta, and in the county must have felt. That is there home, where they work, raise their children, and have their houses. They couldn’t “go home” like the students, they would have had to find another form of shelter. Now with all of these climate change issues continuing to occur due to the county of Santa Barbara refusing to actually act upon their promise and enforce them, the families in the area will continue to suffer the consequences of a county officials refusing to put their greed aside. Like you mentioned, the county of Santa Barbara actually ended up exceeding their emissions, and we are all now witnessing the aftermath of no enforcement and hypocrisy thanks to the county. Aside from that, land that belongs to the Chumash Tribe as mentioned in the article is now beginning to dry up, and the land isn’t even ours to ruin. What I mean by that is the tribes land is being ruined by all of us, including the county, for occupying it and it’s not our land. This is so infuriating because we are destroying something that is sacred to the Chumash Tribe and that is rightfully theirs to begin with.

Reading this article made it sink in that this is our new reality. I’m from LA county borderline Orange County so I haven’t really been affected by these wildfires as much as the residents from Santa Barbara have. It’s really frightening that these fires can be unpredictable and it’s the new norm to expect that any day you have to be evacuated from your house because the threat of imminent death could arrive at your doorstep. Being a student here, reading the article made me angry that it has gotten to this point. I couldn’t even imagine how I would’ve reacted towards the Thomas Cave fire considering I live far away and wouldn’t know the first place to go around here. We are at the point where we’re letting the fires get worse. The fact that we know they’re bad and doesn’t seem to be enough of a problem to start changing our lifestyles in one way or another to prevent another historical fire is unbelievable considering lives could be on the line. 
   <br><br>

Knowing this and having experienced the horrors that you imagine could only happen in a movie, it’s astonishing how although Santa Barbara is known for the modern environmental movement, they still fall short of following through with the policies and regulations they put in place. For example, the article states that in Santa Barbara county, the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas commissions is the amount of cars that come through. They seem to care more about how they look rather than take a step back and realize how their lifestyles and choices in terms of urbanization are contributing to the problem. By 2050, the houses in IV that students enjoy their beautiful sunsets will be gone because of sea level rise and eroded bluffs. It isn’t enough to recognize the problem. The first step in the right direction is to implement enforcement on the city’s regulations because at this rate, we’ll be in a deeper hole than we are already in.

I’m also from Los Angeles and can agree that it’s really frightening seeing how people must adjust to a new norm due to climate change. I don’t think we really pay attention to the effects back in LA because we aren’t dealing with things such as wildfires on such a large basis (depending on which part of LA of course, I’m from South Central so there’s nothing but city surrounding me) yet us and Orange County contribute greatly to affecting other parts of SoCal due to our industrial impact. I could imagine the impact that cars coming through areas like Santa Barbara has too.  There was a brief fire near Goleta right before Thanksgiving last year, and I could see it from my dining commons so clearly. I remember telling my friend, who is also from the same part of LA as me, that it’s crazy witnessing something like this. It was scary yet fascinating to see something like that, but in the back of my mind I knew that it wouldn’t be the last fire I witness. 
   <br><br>

Before I came to SB, my high school environmental science teacher was excited for me to be going to a school in an area that pioneered environmentalism in SoCal, and I was too. However, I see that it really is no different here than any other city. You would think that policies would be more efficient here. I remember her bringing up, if I were to decide to reside here after I graduate, I’d probably get to witness the change in the coast as it erodes away. The fact that it’s true is saddening.

I found it very surprising that the area around Santa Barbara is among the few areas in California to have increased as much as 2.5 to 3 degrees Celcius in California since 1895. Although this didn’t seem like much when I first read the statistics, the fact that it only takes two degrees of temperature increase to cause “catastrophic consequences” puts much into perspective. As the article listed, many of the recent events have already foreshadowed what’s more to come, such as the recent wildfires and the starved whales that were washed ashore. I thought the wildfire mention was very timely, as there was just a fire in Santa Barbara at the end of last year, and all of us Santa Barbara students were there to witness it. In addition to the wildfire, there were many other points in the article that really personalize the global issue of climate change to Santa Barbara residents. The article mentioned how cliffs like Del Playa were quickly eroding, destroying infrastructure. For me, having been on DP so many times, learning that the familiar row of apartments might not even be there in 20 years hit differently then if the article was about another cliff in another part of the world. Having personal costs in the article really gave me a different sense of urgency compared to the more vague, overall article from last week.

As someone who has lived on the east coast my entire life, it is both fascinating and alarming to hear about the “global weirding” occurring in California, specifically the Santa Barbara area. Compared to my hometown, with its four distinct seasons and a wide range of weather patterns, I always thought of Santa Barbara as having a relatively consistent mediterranean climate. However, after hearing about the rare tornadoes and extreme temperature spikes, it is clear that these events are not supposed to happen and climate change is at play here.

   <br><br>

The article “2°C: Beyond the Limit” also highlights the underlying notion that greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world have an impact everywhere else. For example, the article suggests that the drastic growth of cities such as Los Angeles and Orange counties are a likely root of the drastic temperature increases in Santa Barbara and Ventura. Therefore, climate change does not occur in isolation, and requires immediate action in all areas, even those that have not been heavily affected yet.

This article does a great job in forcing American readers to confront the reality of climate change. Most articles regarding this subject focus on small temperature rises and the subsequent sea level rises, issues that appear to affect those far away from us. In contrast, this article focuses on a beautiful, well known region of the US and shows that climate change is directly affecting our country and people. The record temperature increases have directly contributed to the worst wild fires we have experienced and are putting a strain on the economy of the region by creating unpredictable weather. It's very hard to imagine the consequences of a 2 degree rise until you hear of the biggest fires in California's history ravaging people's lives. It's very important that people tie the horrific images they have seen from the fires and its devastation through social media to the fact that temperatures are increasing in an unprecedented way. The fear of economic repercussions from switching from fossil fuels to renewable energies becomes dwarfed by real stories of farmers unable to grow their crops in what is considered some of the best farmland in the world. 

   <br><br>

I also really liked how the graph of the temperature rise that they included of the article also shows the data points that they fitted the curve too. As someone in a stem field of study, this makes the the issue even more real. It shows that these aren't questionable results created by taking data from various sources. Instead these are direct measurements of temperature that anyone can perform themselves and therefore create the same graph and achieve the same results.

It is very frightening to see real life effects of climate change in our county. Climate change is one of those things where you know its happening but don't often see its effects, so when you do, it can be very scary. I was not aware of the tornado warning that Santa Barbara received as I was in my home town, but the fact that there was a tornado in this city is insane! I would never have imagined an actual dangerous tornado coming anywhere near here.
   <br><br>


The part of the article that I thought was the most interesting was the global weirding and the heat spike that left farm animals dead and the land scorched. I had no idea this could even happen, so this truly opened my eyes. I also was very interested in the shift in agriculture that is being done, like the start of using agave for tequila and changing from avocados to dragonfruit. It is very weird that this area is becoming so different and the agriculture does not seem to fit with what you would think should be planted here.

   <br><br>

It is also very scary to see how complacent we have gotten about fires. We see them so often now that its hard to get worked up for each one. I remember when SB was getting the news of the Cave Fire and was asked to evacuate some areas and it was frightening but I felt kind of like "Here we go again." The fact that we have so many fires that this can happen is terrible and the reason why is because of climate change.

This video did a phenomenal job at allowing viewers to visualize the effects of climate on the state of California. Being a resident of southern California for the entirety of my life, I think it is sometimes easy to overlook the effects of climate change when you’re so deeply immersed in the same environment for so long. Watching this video, and getting a better glimpse of the data through the reading, allowed me to take a step back and put on an objective thinking cap. California, and so many other parts of the world, are in tremendous danger. When thinking about the people in my life, it is mind blowing that I know tens of people whose houses have been burnt down and whose families have suddenly been forced to evacuate their houses multiple times in a single year. We cannot keep justifying these actions as normal; we cannot keep justifying our current climate-oriented behavior. This is not normal; there is something bigger going on. Learning the details of California’s degradation over the last few decades has allowed me to gain a new perspective. While this state’s residents boast of the coveted temporal climates, I have forgotten to truly realize and give a name to the degradation of this beautiful state’s climate and environmental features. Thank you for this wake up call.

This new notion of “global weirding” is in no way unfamiliar to me. Growing up in Northern California in the rural county of Mendocino, fires pose a frequent threat to the growing population of residents who live miles and miles out of the nearest city. I’ve lived all over the county, always deep outside of the city limits, and everywhere that I’ve lived we’ve been advised at some point to evacuate our home due to an approaching wildfire. Thankfully, I have been lucky enough to be able to return to my home without any damage to our belongings, animals, and family. But I will always remember, two years ago, how I lost one of my peers as well as her younger brother due to the Redwood Complex Fire that ravaged our community. She, and her family lived deep out in the forest with only one entrance. The fire happened overnight, growing with record speed and strength. That night many people woke up to their home on fire, and as did my classmate. When she and her family escaped their home and drove down their driveway, their car caught fire. Sadly only her parents survived, and our community will forever mourn the loss of their two children. Climate change is already having profound impacts on all of our lives. This was a reminder that not only are we threatened by rising temperatures and strange weather patterns, but our own lives are already at stake. 

   <br><br>

Reading Scott Wilsons’s “2 Degrees C: Beyond the Limit” reminded me that these unprecedented natural disasters are not only happening in my hometown community, but all throughout California and the rest of the world. The fact that temperature changes in Santa Barbara have already exceeded the 2 degree limit put forth in the 2015 Paris Climate Accord is mind-blowing. Santa Barbara is facing the impacts of climate change at an alarming rate. This article conveys an important message in reminding people that the consequences of climate change are being seen all throughout the globe. While it’s important to recognize that the most severe of these effects threaten some of the poorest developing countries, climate change is happening. Now. Everywhere. Even in the bougie city of Santa Barbara. And yes, all of us will face the implications, and if people think that this is bad, just wait for what the future holds if nothing is done to solve this global crisis.

Growing up I was always afraid of my house catching on fire. Just the thought of fire engulfing my entire house and everything in it scared the hell out of me. As I grew older, that fear subsided. However, as climate change and “global weirding” is occurring at an alarmingly fast and intense rate, that fear is reappearing. The story of those kids whose lives were lost in the fire is disheartening and hard to hear. People are already suffering all over the world, in our own hometowns, more than we think. I am also from Northern California, where wildfires are not uncommon. Moving to Santa Barbara, I was naive to think that that issue would be less of a problem here, but clearly, the warming and risk of fire is just as bad, if not worse. The word bougie is perfect to describe the level of wealth and class that constitutes the population of Santa Barbara and the residents that live here, even with the loads of money, still face warming by 2.3 degrees Celsius and have taken little action to fix it. This is a prime example of how people view climate change as an issue everywhere else in the world besides where they live. They know it’s a problem, but are blind to the fact that it is happening right in front of their faces. This article was depressing in the sense that even the county that started Earth Day because of an environmental disaster that occured in their community, can’t even take the steps needed to take to mitigate “global weirding.”

The article, “Two Degrees Celsius: Beyond the Limit” by Scott Wilson, is very compelling and really hits home in that I myself am a Southern California native reading about the direct effects of climate change on my hometown. Wilson talks a lot about how the climate crisis impacts the individual. This reading is a lot less scientific than the reading from last week by David Wallace in that it is more personable and authentic in receiving actual statements from individuals affected. It brings the piece to a more individual level. 
   <br><br>

The purpose of this article is to reveal the effects of climate change and bring it closer to home for all of us which I believe it has successfully done. Some facts from the piece that caught my attention and were very thought provoking were that, “Before the fire and the flood people thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world- important but remote.” I strongly believe that many citizens of the United States felt this way several years ago and sadly including myself. It also mentions the fact that, “A quarter of California’s 40 million residents now live in high-risk fire zones.” I feel this is a fact that many may not know about. 
   <br><br>

Overall, this article was very effective in showing the effects that the climate crisis has already had on the citizens and habitats of California. I hope that it motivates other students and California lovers to take action in preventing the furthering of global warming.

I agree that the article was very compelling and aimed at having Southern California residents truly recognize the effects of climate change that are happening around us. I am also a SoCal native from LA and coming to school here has been a dream, except the realities of climate change are catching up to us. 
   <br><br>

I really liked how the article focused on Santa Barbara and the unique place it has in the climate crisis. The article appealed to UCSB students by discussing the constant threat erosion has to Del Playa Drive that is only going to worsen with time. The erosion is something every UCSB student can clearly see and recognize but it is hard to wrap our head the fact that the iconic street has a finite amount of time left. Another effect explored in the article is the fact that Ventura County is the fastest warming county in the US. That shocked me and really hit hard since I now know the deep impacts that a few degrees Celsius change in temperature can have because of reading Wallace-Well's article last week. The effects of climate change in Santa Barbara have also been felt by the raging fires that the area has experienced in the last couple years. Even just a few months ago before Thanksgiving break, we experienced another fire. The fires are dangerous and scary as well as the fact that they are destroying homes and the environment. I strongly agree with the point that the article makes about how "Before the fire and the flood people thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world- important but remote." Proximity has a huge effect on people and the majority of Santa Barbara's wealthy residency are privileged enough to not have had exposure to the reality and severity of the issues- myself included. With the fires impacting here it forced people to face the extreme times we live in and recognize the toll that climate change is taking.
   <br><br>

 I also found it extremely interesting that it discussed the hypocrisy of Santa Barbara and the toss up between liberal voters and government talking about being environmentally conscious and actually taking action on it. The idea that Santa Barbara can still allow oil to have a say in our politics and continue to frack and drill is preposterous as you just have to take a short walk on the beach to be reminded of the long lasting effects on the environment of the oil spill. After the 1969 disaster, oil should not even be a topic of debate in our environmental policy. I found the propositions of new oil projects incredibly disappointing as I also thought that Santa Barbara's constituency and government wouldn't allow it. 
   <br><br>

Overall I found this article very interesting and eye opening as it attacked the issue of proximity by focusing on the many ways that Santa Barbara is in the middle of the climate crisis and needs to step up the ways we handle it.

In “2ºC beyond the limit”, the author Scott Wilson starts off with the experience of a Santa Barbara camping resort manager for the past few years. With the natural disasters happening more and more frequent, the manager is now getting used to dealing with them. This anecdote shows that the climate in California is getting worse. Due to the worsen climate, the number of habitants and habitats in California has drastically decreased; whales are found dead and washed up on shores in San Francisco. Scott Wilson furthered his argument by listing out a natural disaster happened in the recent years: the 2017 Thomas fire in Santa Barbara and a severe storm combined killed 23 people. 
   <br><br>
People used to think climate change is important but remote, yet all these evidences show that climate change is already here. 
   <br><br>
The article also showed some housings in Isla Vista that are being damaged by the waves due to the rise of sea level. Santa Barbara is such a beautiful and natural place, finding out that climate change is affecting something this close to me makes me realize how urgent the situation is. 
   <br><br>
Politic plays an important role in climate change as well. Santa Barbara is falling behind its anti-pollution goals and it is making me wonder if they are unable or unwilling to make the change.
   <br><br>
Overall, “2 degrees beyond the limit” is definitely giving me a sense of urgency and a pressure to act right now by making more environmentally sensible life choices.

In the article “Beyond The Limit,” the sentence that I can most relate with is “We are always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps hat really change things that will cost something.” All human beings nowadays know exactly what we are facing a severe climate crisis, but because it will cost too much to change, a lot of us refuse to change into a better way to help our climate to change into a better condition. 

   <br><br>



 Just as Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams said:” Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world—something important but remote,” I thought climate change in the same way until I was there when mountain fire was there again in Santa Barbara in 2019. The fire was so near to our dormitory and it was so terrifying that we didn’t even go out of our room that night. I saw fire and tons of smoke coming out of that mountain towards the whole Goleta areas. Yet, it was not a one-time event. The fire has come to Santa Barbara regularly for years, disrupting our normal lives, destructing natural habitats and human properties, or even human lives. This is a severe issue we really need to put effort to deal with, or it will come back year after year, annoying us all generation by generation. 


   <br><br>


 The article primarily focuses on the climate situation in LA and Santa Barbara currently. We can see the temperature here rises rapidly. If it continues to increase, then our planet will come to the moment that we have NO RETURN. It really alarms me to take some action to prevent that moment from coming so fast.

I agree that one of the most relatable issues they discussed in the article was that those of us living in Santa Barbara are unwilling to make large-scale changes. Despite it being filled with some of the wealthiest people. I have lived in Isla Vista for fours years now and can say that I have watched fire season get progressively worse every year. This has become so common that it is now part of our reality. So much that the school has had to cancel classes multiple times because of the fires. Yet despite all the recently devastating fires little action has been done to bring attention to climate change. 

<br><br>
Unfortunately the statement made by County Supervisor Das Williams seems to ring true. Santa Barbara has a long history of being supportive of the climate crisis yet for so long has ignored its duties to protect this land. As they pointed out in the article we have been exceeding its 2007 greenhouse gas emissions by 14%. I must admit I also largely underestimated the severity of the issue until recently. I have fallen in love with Santa Barbara sense moving here from San Diego four years ago and to see the devastation that seems to keep coming back every year is alarming. I hope that those of use that have now become very aware of the issue can help those that have been fighting and help reduce the pressures of climate change and help protect from its almost year round fire season. The privilege that many of us have had to live in this beautiful town unbothered by the by climate change is coming to an end.
<br><hr>
I agree with both comments as well. I especially think it is important to think about the idea that we will not change if it costs something. This is true for Santa Barbara, but it is also true for most of the world. This is one of the main reasons it is so difficult to address climate change and work towards solutions. Yes, the biggest problems have to do with the meat industry, coal, fast fashion, and oil. Solving those issues would involve billionaires not being selfish and greedy (which we know isn’t exactly possible, or else they wouldn’t be billionaires). But on a person to person lifestyle level, we could solve climate change if everyone on the planet decided to stop driving cars, purchasing beef, and only shopping for clothes at Goodwill for the rest of the lives. This is a lot to expect of a society, and it’s the classic issue of “well if it’s only me then it won’t make a difference, and there’s no way everyone will do it so I might as well continue living my comfortable life.” This is what makes the climate crisis so daunting to me. We can’t get big industries to change, but we can’t get individuals to change on a large enough scale to make a difference either, so what’s left?

This article opened my eyes to the reality that climate change is really only going to get worse from here. We are just starting to see the effects from our previous actions and we are seeing it manifest into fires that are taking homes and burning down fields.These are people's livelihoods being taken away or threatened. It’s sad to know that this is what it will take for some people to finally act. The areas affected in these fires were relatively wealthy and were able to recover fairly quickly and take precautions. But the reality is, that the preventive measures these people are making, will be useless in the long run. These areas especially Ventura, are continuing to heat up rapidly and we need to address the actual issue, climate change.
<br><br>

I also find it incredibly ironic that Santa Barbara which is known as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement is struggling to meet its goal for greenhouse gas emissions. I always had this preconceived notion that Santa Barbara was a leader in these environmental problems based on all the great initiatives being proposed to lower said emissions. It just makes me very pessimistic that if a place as progressive as Santa Barbara is struggling to address Climate Change, then how can other cities, especially the more conservative ones.
<br><br>

I also found the issue of PG&E very concerning. When they cut the power it leaves people who depend on it to eat and stay warm defenseless. Not everyone is wealthy enough to buy backup generators and it just makes me think again about how it is the poor who will suffer more.

I agree with your notion on the fact that the preventative measures being taken will be useless in the long run.Tomas Morales Rebecchi, the senior Central Coast organizer for the Nonprofit Food and Water Watch states,"There are no teeth in these plans.The rules are just words on paper". It feels like the monster we as humans made called climate change is biting back out of anger. Every year these natural disasters get worse and all we as the public do is send prayers and fight it the best we can but each time more casualties occur. Only after it affects the public personally will this become a bigger concern. As of now Californians will continue to make money off of killing our planet and hope a fire doesn't destroy the lives of hundreds. I used to believe California was a safe state with the only real threat being earthquakes but that is not the case.Every day is seems like a natural disaster waiting to happen.
<br><br>
The biggest difference I noticed coming to UCSB from my hometown was how environmentally greener it seemed. It was shocking to read in the article "Beyond the Limit" that Santa Barbara is exceeding greenhouse emission levels by 14 percent. It was even more shocking to read that erosion of the cliffs on Del Playa Drive is happening less than a bike ride away. Reading that I also immediately thought if Santa Barbara is doing bad imagine how much worse it is in other parts of California, especially where climate change is believed to be a hoax. I find it very frustrating that the world is continually being damaged and the only proof the population will believe is when it happens to them. Additionally, people and companies who have a voice or authority are all talk no action. They only seem to feed us what we want hear to make us shut up or soothe our worries. How many of those who have promised to take action  have actually done it?

I am from Napa CA and was a sophomore here in 2017. What many people don't remember about that fall/winter is that there were two major fires at the same time in California. One was the Thomas fire here in SB, and the other being the Tubbs fire in the Napa/Sonoma Valley. Other than the smoke which eventually got so bad they cancelled finals, my life was relatively unchanged. 
 <br><br>
Many of my friends weren't so lucky however. This article discusses the evacuations and how they seemed to be an inconvenience for many people. What I don't think it emphasizes is the aftermath and entire communities that are left homeless following major fires such as these. Families are still struggling to recoup from the aftermath of the devastating fires, and their lives are forever changed. 
 <br><br>
These temperature rises aren’t simply an environmental problem. They directly lead to entire communities and livelihoods being changed. People lose pets, homes, and in some cases, loved ones. These fires are an immediate threat to California and we are doing nothing about it.

I completely agree that the fires present an immediate threat. Additionally, I felt that the greater Santa Barbara community represents a microcosm of the United States in general when it comes to climate. Generally, the effects of climate change don’t have an effect on us on a day to day basis. With that being the case, many people don’t think about how they could help curb the most troubling trends on a regular basis. In that sense, the immediacy of the issue is not always present. I think that the farmers who diversified crops took a fine first step but that is still merely a temporary solution that doesn’t curb the source problem: emissions.

 <br><br>

At the same time, this article also showed that climate change has had immediate effects on our community. Like you, I was a student at UCSB during the Thomas Fire and I vividly remember the dark sky, ash in the air, and not knowing whether we would have power at any given time for almost two weeks. Despite the climate crisis hitting so close to home, though, the article describes just how far behind Santa Barbara is lacking on various environmental goals and standards. In that sense I am ashamed at how closely our community seems to meet the “poser” reputation, especially knowing how passionate so many students are on the subject.  Overall, the most surprising part of the article wasn’t that climate change is hitting close to home. The most surprising part was how little progress this community has made even though, as you described, these changes can have devastating effects. Such devastating events, while tragic, may also be an opportunity if communities can unite and respond the right way. To this point, though, that has not really happened for SB.

As a student living in Santa Barbara these two and a half years, I witnessed and experienced how the fires happened almost every year and the impacts the fires had brought to the community. Not only saying how it has affected the people who lost their houses/property due to the fire and the many wildlife died; the smoke and dust the fire caused were everywhere affecting the air quality and people’s health. I do think it is time we all should start realizing how global warming is real and happening right now. It is hard just like what the article had said, to responsibly approve a project that will cause environmental problem / climate crisis and on the other hand say will deal with climate change. And it is never easy to deal with climate crisis without posing any cost on the project or our economy.But I think this is what we all should be working on, to find a balance and find out the best solution that would have the least cost but at the same time to solve the climate problem.If the government/county just say and do nothing, we will never be able to fully and seriously start working on the problem.
 <br><br>
Not only the impacts that I have mentioned above are something we should consider when talking about the climate change crisis, the article has talked about how it affected the people who rely on growing crops to make money and maintain their lives. Switching to tropical crops due to decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature are never the best final solution to deal with the crisis. As long as the climate problem still exists, the people are still facing the unexpected impacts that they might face one day.

Growing up in Los Angeles, I didn't worry or ever really hear about anything potentially dangerous other than driving accidents that occur when it rains. The though of tornadoes, wildfires, and extreme storms never crossed my mind and were only thought to happen in other places like the mid-west or internationally. But now like the article "2 Degrees C; Behind the Limit" suggests these things are at our doorstep. As a University, UCSB has been forced to shut down operations due to wildfires twice over the past three years, and in both situations waited until conditions were extremely bad for students and faculty. Santa Barbara is supposed to be a paradise but if things continue to go on as they are, Santa Barbara would become nothing more than a scorched wasteland riddled by tornadoes and mudslides. It is a tough thing to aid and even care about disasters abroad so now that it finally in our backyard, what are we going to do differently? Or are we just going to watch our home fall apart?

Before reading the article, “2°C: Beyond the limit” by Scott Wilson, I had known about the Paris Agreement, but I had no idea that Santa Barbara had already surpassed the threshold of 2 degrees Celsius. I have grown up in Southern California for all of my life, and luckily have never been near or experienced a wildfire, so when we experienced the Cave Fire back in November, the issues of climate change became more real and personal to me. This article brings the issue of climate change right to its readers and especially since it is focused on the issue in the Santa Barbara area, it serves as a wake up call for all those who know that climate change is happening, but remain inactive. One quote that struck me was that “before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world.” When most people think of climate change, they probably think of rising temperatures in remote countries and ice melting in the poles, places that so distant to us, however climate change is right in our own backyard. Most people here know about the crumbing and eroded cliffs along Del Playa and the tar on the beaches and although people may see these as coastal issues, these are more so issues of climate change. This article helps bring climate change into a perspective that forces us to listen because it brings the issue right into our own lives.

I fully agree that  2°C: Beyond the limit helps bring climate change into a perspective that forces us to listen and to take climate change into account because it can directly impact our lives as students here at UCSB. Growing up in Southern California, I faintly remember experiences the Witch Fires and others in 2007, but the Cave Fires in November were a very fresh and alarming experience. Passing under Henley Gate and driving away from school (what seemed like directly into the fires) was a pretty surreal experience as many of us observed that the fire had the potential to do some major damage. Taking English 23 and 2°C: Beyond the limit have allowed me to look back at that experience with a very different perspective and hopefully I apply it to similar experiences ahead. 
<br><br>
Additionally, both Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have already surpassed the temperature increase threshold set by the 2015 climate accords by a significant amount. Without a doubt, this is a startling trend for the region I go to school in and for the area that I’ve become very familiar with over the last few years. These trends are also very interesting considering the fact that Santa Barbara, and very much so UCSB, were a huge part of the establishment and launch of the modern environmental movement which would eventually galvanize millions across the country. Many people would probably assume that the general Santa Barbara area has implemented many up-to-date environmental programs, technologies, policy, etc. to help combat climate change and environmental degradation, due to its close relation and tie to UCSB which is considered one of the most progressive schools on the west coast. However, 2°C: Beyond the limit points out that although “much of the environmental expertise and activism that grew up around the movement is still based here…. Santa Barbara is often accused of caring more about how it looks than how it lives.”. Lastly, the article’s discussion and Ken’s comments regarding “Global Weirding” was another very alarming topic, unnerving to imagine such unstable and unpredictable patterns in our weather and climate that is occuring in several places across the country.
<br><hr>

I would like to emphasize how affected by the whole situation we are, yet sometimes I feel it is not taken seriously. For example, I knew there was tar on the beaches, some of my friends had told me this before I got here, but I never fully knew why. The third largest oil spill in US history happened here, that fully blew my mind and my entire outlook on the beaches here has changed. For me what’s even more frightening is not that this could happen again (because it surly can), but the oil industry is influencing Santa Barbara to not institute environmental legislation. This is not only happening on the national scale in Congress and the White House, but on local scales where the change should be started. We know the problem, its time to fix it. 
<br><br>
I would also like to mention the effect of the fires. I remember learning about the evacuations because of the fires before I came here and I pushed it off like it was not a big deal, because in the San Francisco Bay, it had no threat to us. Now with the Cave Fire and the frequency of the situation, not to mention how close I am to it now, it worries me. This fire was so close, for me it hit closer than the Fire in Santa Rosa did, even though that one had large effects on the entire Bay Area. I had sports canceled for over a week for a fire that was miles away from me. It all hits home too close now.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with you on how that quote stood out as I similarily felt that way about it when reading the article. I also thought that that tied back to last week's lecture in a way, where Ken said that people see climate change is this distant issue that doesn't directly affect them because they feel that its effects are not immediate. I think this is the primary culprit as to how this issue has continued on for so long and how so many are unable to see the severity of things because it is not affecting them or those within close proximity of them.  However, this ideology is being blinded by the reality that climate change has been affecting places everywhere, even if it isn't your hometown. It definitely is time for people to wake up and come to the realization that climate change is driven by our own activity, and especially those with more affluence that are contributing more to emissions should be actively aware of the consequences of their actions. We have let things gone to the point of extreme weather events and destruction caused by the fires such as in Ventura County, and if that isn't a wake-up call in itself then I truly don't know what is.

Again the statements made in the article shocked me in many ways. Imagine running a business  for two decades straight only to have a fire strip it away. Imagine investing over a 100,000 dollars on a fire-preventing system only to find out it doesn't work. And their issues are just the human trauma caused by the underlying problem that is te fast rising temperature here in California. Also 43% of all species apparently got wiped out in this last century, wildfires destroy thousands of acres and 23 people lost their life's during fires. The article notes so much negative points it is hard to stay positive regarding the oncoming crisis we are facing. By 2060 the erosion will have taken 78% of the coastline (including the house I now live in  and 40 million Californians already live in a fire-dangerous zone. Whilst walking on the beach you still find the remains of an oil leak over half a century ago. This illustrates the long proces of destruction we started about 100 years ago, that just now results in severe, undeniable consequences. Once again this article illustrates that the time to act is now.

Santa Barbara has been at the forefront of environmental movements for many years, and yet, it seems that the area is among the places in our country getting hit the hardest by climate change. I remember last quarter when there were a couple different wildfires in the area, the latter of which was enough of a threat to cancel a whole day of classes. When this happened, I do not remember hearing anyone talk about this is relation to climate change. We were all concerned, of course, for our own safety and the safety of others, but it didn’t seem apparent that anyone was taking the time to put this into an environmental context. 
<br><br>

 It is crucial to notice what is happening around us and think about the environmental implications that these events have. Larger things that the article mentioned, such as the fact that the central valley can no longer grow certain crops, may not be easily noticed by students like us. However, we can take some time to look around us and notice different things such as the summer warmth feeling slightly longer or the winters back home feeling less cold, or an increase in wildfires, big or small, in our area. Noticing these things is essential in being inspired to act to prevent further climate change, especially in areas such as Santa Barbara that we call home.

We’ve all heard that climate change is happening, yet often it feels as if it’s a distant future that won’t catch up to us anytime soon. Why is this? Why is there a disconnect between the evidence and the cause? Precisely what is it that has made us see wildfires and mudslides consistently each year as something normal, something that just happens? This article really exemplifies the change that is occuring, right in our own backyard. Ventura county has already warmed 2.6 degrees. It’s easy to hear that as just a number without meaning, but 2.6 degrees is so much. Enough to change the agriculture of the area, where tropical fruit now can grow better than avocados. That’s already 0.6 degrees more than the limit set by climate agreements. Hearing how close the climate crisis is hitting to my home is scary; the redwoods that I grew up in are now threatened, the kelp forests of the Channel Islands that I’ve dived in are thinning more and more, Joshua trees are facing possible endangerment, even the erosion of the cliffs in Isla Vista occuring in our literal backyard. 
<br><br>
So why then does the issue still feel so distant? The evidence is in front of us. We need to take immediate aggressive action, but we haven’t. If all of this has already occurred without everyone realizing that this crisis is literally sitting on our doorstep, what more will it take? The delay between the time it takes to pollute and the effects of the pollution have stalled us thus far, despite the fact that we’ve known that there’s a problem since the mid 20th century, but we cannot let this perpetuate. We simply cannot afford to wait any longer than we have. We need to get to the root of what causes our inaction despite the obvious catastrophe and undergo a monuments change to our culture and politics. Although we live in one of the most environmentally progressive areas of the US, we still have a long ways to go.

Fires, floods and other natural disasters are not the disease, they are merely the symptoms.The article 20C: Beyond the Limit is a powerful treatise of some of the more localized effects climate change has already had on California environments, hosting startling statistic including the terrifying finding that some desert habitats have lost 43% of their species in the last century, as well as the massive temperature rises experienced in Ventura and Santa Barbara county. Similarly, the increased intensity caused by climate change of natural disasters has also brought the issue of climate change into local areas, causing a virtually year round fire season, unpredictable rain storms, and increased erosion of  seaside properties. One major factor in a regions general acknowledgement or incentive to fix a problem is directly related to their proximity to said problem. Many regions hosting large populations of individuals who actively deny anthropogenic change are also removed from the effects of climate change, yet when these effects become more powerful and localized, those individuals began to acknowledge that something has in fact changed, or at least admit that non-normal events are occuring.

Ironically, the same individuals who deny the need for progression to clean energy from new inventions which could potentially provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, allow the US to remove any present of future reliance it may have on other countries for fossil fuels, and decrease the cost of energy supply. Oh and there also is the stipulation that it might save all the species of the planet. Just that little detail. With such powerful benefits, and such severe consequences if drastic measures are not taken, it simply does not make sense for the general public to not be up in arms for change, yet a large portion of the population still denies such change. Part of the problem is a lack of education on the matter in denial controlled regions, households or companies, and part of the problem is a simple lack of acceptance of the evidence. As many crops and animals die due to heatwaves, and other historically farmed crops must be switched to less water intensive plants due to drought, wealthy cities put on mask and parade climate regulations in the public view, while ignoring the words they themselves parade. We have already reached a point when climate change has effected that ability of some of California's wealthiest residents to receive a supply of power without stipulations that apply in high fire risk situations, a problem which could easily be prevented by localized power such as solar panels or tiles putting energy into a powerwall.
<br><br>
I love how the use of the word clout was added, as it demonstrates that environmental justice is being strongly pursued by students and younger individuals, and thats wonderful, and I support all who fight for justice, but it should not need to be the fight of those who have neither caused the problem or have the money to help fix the issue. Rightly, more than just a carbon tax should be levied on the problem, but also heavy watering taxes for farmers who over irrigate in low rainfall regions, meat taxes for those who eat large quantities of methane factories, and a plastic tax on petroleum products especially plastics. This last tax is essential, as no matter how much you can deny the facts about climate change, you can not deny physical evidence such as a “trash island” the size of Texas, or the thousands of animals that are found starved with stomaches filled with plastic. Certain regions already have made the switch; cities such as Seattle gaining 94% of its energy from renewable sources and 98% from clean ones, and larger areas including Costa Rica and Iceland with 99% and 99.99% of energy coming from renewables respectively. The longer we wait to fix our problems, the more it will cost us both economically and environmentally and the harder it will be. The time to act is now.

Much like last week’s reading, this article served as a reality check for me. The desolation of the climate crisis is comparable to a recurring nightmare: distressing, yet still perpetuating.
<br><br>


It is beyond petrifying to imagine my childhood home going up in flames, but as fires have continued to appear as a staple in our daily news reports, it has become easier and easier for me to picture this absolute horror manifesting into a reality in the foreseeable future.

<br><br>

In addition to this, farmers, whose livelihoods are singularly reliant on the success of their yield, must adapt to our everchanging climate. They have gone from growing water-dependent crops like avocados to tropical crops such as finger limes, a fruit that is not even native to our state- let alone our country- dragon fruit, passion fruit, and coffee. It is devastating to learn that these individuals must adjust their way of life in order to better suit the depleting amount of water being replaced by our ecosystem.
<br><br>


Subsequently, Santa Barbara must see past their title as “the birthplace of the modern environmental movement.” Not only are the town’s citizens prone to the direct harm of climate change, but they are also forced to discover lifestyle changes and workarounds to the damage, such as home evacuations, eroding sidewalks, and the eradication of cliffs- and in turn, the extermination of possible university housing- on UCSB’s Del Playa Drive due to rising sea levels. Furthermore, the town’s beauty and reputation are clearly subject to destruction. How much longer until the decimation causes our representatives to actually consider making a difference?

I think that the people of Santa Barbara need to realize the importance of their title as "the birthplace of the modern environmental movement." We, Santa Barbara, are one of the most environmentally conscious areas IN THE WORLD. As "the birthplace of the modern environmental movement," and with average temperatures already rising by 2.3 degrees Celsius, the place is here and the time is now to be an example to the rest of the world that action can be taken. We have the opportunity to be the prime example on the globe of fighting the climate crisis. If "the birthplace of the modern environmental movement" does not take action, who will?


<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that it's far over time for the Santa Barbara county to acknowledge the significant impact it can play in taking action. Around campus and within the city, the county prides itself on being "the birthplace of the modern environmental movement," but continues to promote and support unhealthy actions, such as in oil mining and focus on 'beautification' and maintenance. Often overlooking the real implications of such problems, focused rather on monetary donations. The point you raise on Del Playa's oceanside living is interesting as well, as you suggest removing houses from the bluff entirely. Which as hopeful of an outlook it is, may be pushed back upon given view and rental price, but at what cost is safety a concern? At what point would renters and home owners rather wake up and walk to the beach, over risk their own safety?
<br><br>
The article of 2°C: Beyond the limit by Scott Wilson highlights these issues further with the acknowledgement of worry after the fact and during disaster rather than prior. Including examples of those affected from the county of Santa Barbara, the real question is, when will enough be enough? Would a housing crisis cause any action, or result in a stalemate of inaction, as 'political powers' fought against one another to defend their own interests? Or would it also just be added to the list of 'other' problems facing the county, caused by a rising temperature within the area.
<br><hr>
I think that regardless of whether one believes in the climate crisis or is one that has been misled by the false information given by the government and many different false articles, places such as Santa Barbara need to look around and look at what is happening to their county and find things to do that can help our environment and our home. While we have the title as "the birthplace of the modern environmental movement" we have been slacking in our efforts to help our planet and specifically help our town. If the residents of Santa Barbara want to continue living in this town that they call home, it's important to start expanding to other cities that are faced with similar consequences and expand our outreach. Whether you believe that this is just another cycle of horrific storms and fires or you can truly see what is happening right now with the climate crisis, there is still something to be done about what is currently happening.

<br><br>

Many of you put up a good argument that was mentioned in the article about the question of what would a housing crisis do to promote action within a town. For many people in Isla Vista, living on Del Playa, they have had their decks torn down due to weather conditions and many fear losing their house due to rising sea levels. What will it take for people to take more steps towards helping this earth?

<br><hr>
While there is work being done to make Santa Barbara a carbon neutral city, it is not nearly enough nor is it at a past enough pace. Just a few months ago, a fire broke out very close to campus, and while it may not have caused any damage to UCSB, there were many who lived close by that were forced to evacuate, while students all across campus watched the fire from their dorm windows. If more effective measures aren't taken towards becoming carbon neutral and shifting to renewable resources, I feel that it's likely a fire will break out near campus and may result in damage, while putting students and faculty in danger. The question is not whether or not more change must be made, it's how much more damage will occur before we make any real progress.

<br><hr>
I found it really interesting that of all places in California Santa Barbara is one to have one of the highest temperature rises. To me, it adds to the irony of this city claiming their commitment to environment safety and betterment, as it clearly hasn't done so. I think it also goes to show that we can't truly predict where climate change will have the most effect. I would have thought areas around LA or in the dessert would be the ones to accumulate temperature rise the fastest but the fact such a beautiful, cool(ish), coastal town has is shocking to me.
<br><br>
I have also sat one the beach and seen pieces of the cliff break off and would be hesitant to live in any house where the cliffs are covered in nets. It's crazy to see how many alumni I've met, and students, and staff who went here and lived on DP,  but how if my future children were to be future gauchos, they may never know DP as it is today.
<br><br>
I think as humanity we've trapped ourselves in a very self destructive cycle, fueling money into companies that continue to accelerate the rate of this climate change, as well as having formed lifestyle habits that we can't seem to pull ourselves out of and thus we will have all the future consequences to face.

<br><hr>
It was also a reality check for me, opening my eyes to the environmental concerns that affect where I currently live. It is ironic that we are "the birthplace of the modern environmental movement," but fail to live up to the expectations set before us. I found it really shocking that our average temperature has risen so high as well.  An increase of 2.3 degrees celsius is insane, yet people aren't doing much to combat the problem.

<br><hr>
Well,  one thing that strikes me the most in your comment is that people in Santa Barbara are prone to the direct harm of climate change. But think about it, just like Ken said in this YouTube video,  Santa Barbara definitely has some of the best weather conditions in the entire country or even the world. If, the most suitable places for living on this planet( such as Santa Barbara) are already under the threat of rapid climate change, what severe consequences could it have on other parts of world where the weather is not as good as here. Imagine what would life be like in the sub-Sahara Africa where prolonged droughts persisted for years and people don't get precipitation to sustain themselves and their livestock. Things are even worse in these places! So with the temperature rising so rapidly in central coast California that has a breezing Mediterranean climate , we as a global citizen must be able to envision what would be the even more profound consequences of such human-induced changes for areas that have much harsher environmental conditions on the globe.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. It saddens me that Isla Vista won't exist in 50 years. It is time for Santa Barbara citizens and climate activists to stand together and actually pushback oil drilling and fracking, two major problems in our area. Santa Barbara can talk the talk but can we walk the walk?
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your response.  “2°C: Beyond the Limit” served as a reality check for me as well; I have been aware of the necessity of changing legislature and quickly moving to sustainable energy for a long time but did not truly understand how rapidly the changing climate is destroying much of what I know to be true.  I loved your analogy to a recurring nightmare; I agree that the climate crisis can be likened to this type of event, something so devastating and destructive yet seemingly completely out of one’s control.  I can not imagine being in the midst of a wildfire yet it is something I am being forced to accept a very valid potential reality.
<br><br>


I was perplexed by the realization that the vast majority of Del Playa may be gone much sooner than I want to imagine.  This would not only cause destruction of university housing; it would cause a complete change to life at UCSB as we currently know it.  Del Playa Drive is a huge social ground for many UCSB students, with one of the major draws being its location right next to the ocean.  So many students visit this road over the course of a week that the destruction of this housing due would have a huge affect on the student population, not to mention on the city of Santa Barabra as a whole.  This town, prided on the natural beauty of the landscape, is so prone to destruction that I do not understand how representatives have yet decided to implement change.

<br><hr>

I agree that Santa Barbara, and the rest of the U.S., needs to stop expecting the world to follow along with our every move. We have this idea that, if we improve one aspect of something to make it more sustainable, we can sit back because it will fix everything. Then, we become angry and hopeless when that one small change ends up not being the solution for a problem that started centuries ago. This has to be a continuous fight to end climate change, so Santa Barbara should follow what it preaches and stop waiting to see if the world will catch up. 
<br><br>

Hearing about how the temperature rise is scorching crops across Santa Barbara County is terrifying. I’m from Salinas, a city that is very dependent on agriculture to (it’s called the Salad Bowl of the World), so I understand how detrimental the loss of crops can be. The Salinas Valley is responsible for 80% of the produce across the U.S. and 30% produce across the world. If crops were to get scorched by temperature rise here, there would be a great loss of food and jobs. There is a great number of people who depend on agriculture in California
<br><br>

The generations currently living seem to be somewhat desensitized to the effects of climate change that have become common occurrences. When the Cave Fire ignited in November, I remember seeing it through my window, how it started as a small flame and quickly grew within a few hours. Looking back on it, I wasn’t very phased by it. It was scary to see it spread across the hill, but it was something I perceived as normal. This perception was not normal at all, but we hear about natural disasters happening every day and I believe that it has come to a point where it is almost expected. Fires are normal for California, but the tornado that was reported to be heading to Santa Barbara was not. Even so, I cannot say that I’m surprised by it. “Global weirding” is starting to become normal. What we feared climate change would bring us is now our reality.

Reading “2 degrees beyond the limit” made me stop to think about how much California has changed climate-wise from my childhood to now. I am from the bay area, so I was not necessarily familiar with southern California fires and mudslides. I remember when it became obvious to us that everything was changing, around 2015 we had fires near my hometown. It made me realize something with the environment was going downhill because around that season years prior, we were having rainstorms but now it was ash coming down outside. Over the years our natural disaster fears have changed, my mother used to worry about me here in Santa Barbara and say be careful with earthquakes or tsunamis, but now we worry about the fires. 
<br><br>
The statistics that Wilson presented left me surprised because I did not know Santa Barbara (such an idea weather “paradise”) was going through such drastic climate effects. Their stories and pictures left me devastated to see the effects of the fires and especially the learning of the innocent animals that are dying due to these natural disasters. It was interesting to read Ruskey’s story of how he turned to plant exotic fruits on his farm because it is probably what most farmers will do in a couple of years. We will have to change our diet whether we like it or not because luxuries like avocados are hard to harvest in our changing environment. 
<br><br>
Wilson’s section about Santa Barbara failing to accomplish their own pollution/green goals is an example of how hard it is for Americans to carry out what they preach about the environment. I think this also brings up the issue that the reason why big change is not occurring is because of the oil companies near here who do not want any more environmental regulation. Instead of following through with environmental goals, even an eco-friendly place like Santa Barbara is trapped by the industries who cause the most harm. I considered UCSB as a pretty environmentally friendly place to live because everyone is biking around and trying to compost or do these little things. People always go around saying they will decrease their carbon footprint but their lifestyle never changes and no one wants to give up their comfortable life. Myself included, of course, I always think about changing my diet and incorporating sustainability to my lifestyle.

It was sad, yet not surprising, to learn that global warming has infiltrated into becoming a local issue instead of just a global one.  The article “2°C: Beyond the limit” really gave me a sense of just how incredibly impacted California is by this climate crisis and the lack of progress California officials have made to resolve some of these issues.  Having lived in Southern California my entire life, it was interesting yet saddening to learn about how global warming is affecting different aspects of this beautiful and eclectic state.  From the failure of some of the best produce in the world, to the erosion of the best views on the coast line, it seems this issue hits closer to home than I initially understood.  When I first heard about the devastating fires in Santa Barbara, I was not aware that global warming played such a large role in the severity and devastation of these events.  However, as I learned more about them from the article, I was surprised to hear that some of the worst fires in California’s history happened within the span of the past two years.  This truly baffles me and gives this issue an even greater sense of urgency.  As a response, people are comprosing so many aspects of their life in California to protect themselves from the growing severity of the climate crisis.  Things such as growing different crops to moving residencies multiple times a year are just some examples of the ways Californians are compromising their lives.  If this intense level of warming continues, the drastic changes that are being made to California will simply be catastrophic.
<br><br>


Looking into the future, I have little hope that the way I know California now will be the way future generations will know California.  At the rate that devastation is affecting California, it is difficult to predict the condition of this state in even 10 years.  On a more personal level, the fact that climate change is causing damage to places like Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista really makes me realize that although I am not directly affected by climate change, people in my local community are experiencing these effects everyday.  I hope that sooner rather than later state officials will take more action in slowing the effects that climate change is having on California.

While reading the article “2°C Beyond the Limit,” I was surprised to hear that Santa Barbara and Ventura have both already warmed up by more than 2°C over the last 120+ years. The main reason why I find this extremely alarming is because both of these counties exceeded the Paris Agreement which was designed to keep global average temperatures at a certain number. Hearing Ken say that 40 million California residents are currently living in danger is scary. With all the fires and oil spills that have been occurring in these areas over the last couple of years, Santa Barbara and Ventura residents have been faced with several hardships like mud slides, emergency evacuations, and the loss of their homes.
<br><br>

The thing that makes me sad the most are the innocent animals being affected by all of these natural disasters. I can only imagine how they feel to have their habitats completely destroyed. Little do they know that we’re the main reason for it. To hear that 43% of the species found in the desert have been lost has me at a loss of words. One part of the article that really broke my heart was reading about the 13 whales that washed ashore dead, most likely due to starvation. Because of our actions, these poor creatures are the ones who are suffering. I just wish there was some way I could help them, because they do not deserve to be the ones who are paying for our wrongdoings. For this reason, I don’t think it’s a good idea, at all, for the oil industry to expand their drilling operations. If this is how animals in the ocean are already being affected, then I don’t even want to think about how much worse it would get for them.
<br><br>

Del Playa is what Isla Vista and UCSB are known for. As a UCSB student I feel like I can say that DP is a staple for all of us. No matter how many reinforcements the city continues to put up, these cliffs will no longer exist within the next couple of years due to the sea-levels rising. If the DP houses on the cliffs continue to collapse, will DP really feel like DP anymore?

I agree that the increase of temperature within recent years in the Santa Barbara/Ventura areas is extremely alarming. Before coming to UCSB, I had never really seen the effects of climate change up close. To be honest, I didn't expect Santa Barbara to be so heavily effected of all places. I always thought of Santa Barbara as a center of agricultural production and greenery. When I got here, that's exactly what I saw. However, within the first few months, I witnessed one of the fires first hand. It was scary to see how climate change is alive and well. The fire made me think of how myself and others around me could have been affected. In addition to this, it is alarming to think that the same houses that some of my friends live in on DP could be destroyed by erosion by as early as 2060. 

<br><br>

The fact that California is one of the nation's top producers of key staple foods gives even greater reason to bring attention to the issue and take action. I agree with you that it is a bad idea for the oil industry to expand their drilling operations, and I think that a possible viable solution to this issue would be to try to influence political action to enforce environmental restrictions on these drilling operations. Of course, these businesses will do what they can to continue their operations. Santa Barbara represents the environment in many ways, and I think that the county government should do more to ensure that drilling operations are heavily restricted as well as enforce other laws that would help stop climate change and reduce fires, droughts, etc.

What stood out to me most after the reading and Ken's video, was the conflicts farmers are facing. They are being forced to switch to crops they aren't sure will be profitable, such as Agave. With this shift away from the typical nuts and fruit previously grown, a substantial change in our food supply will occur, because as Ken points out, California produces half of the United States' fruits and nuts. A dramatic change in food supply would be noticed by many Americans, thus, hopefully bringing more awareness to the crisis at hand. I feel the likelihood of a change in prices of almonds or grapes being attributed to climate change are low. Similar to how climate change's seemingly slow pace makes some disregard it as a priority, a change in price of fruit will likely not spike, I assume it would increase gradually as more farmers switch causing many to not look past the surface and be blind to how climate change is affecting not just those in California or on the coasts, but people everywhere. I'm hoping it doesn't get to this point, but it was interesting to me, the potential consequences the effects of climate change bring about that you have to look a little harder for. 

<br><br>

I'm a first year at UCSB, and while I previously knew about the oil spill and some cliff erosion in IV, I was unpleasantly surprised to hear about the Santa Barbara local government. According to the article, the Santa Barbara government talks the talk but doesn't quite walk the walk. This is troubling because this is the so-called birthplace of this green movement, and if they can't reduce emissions or positively affect climate change, how are others supposed to follow in their footsteps. I understand that some inside are trying to help the cause, it's honestly just a little bit disheartening.



</p><hr>


<p>

Something worth mentioning is that Santa Barbara county’s climate action plan imposes no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals, and the county conducts an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions only once every three years. This reminds me of what I have learned from week 1. One possible explanation for why it takes the government so long to get tough on pollution is the uneven distribution of pain. So long as the local hands have control over enforcement, officials do not really have the incentive to act. Just as it says in our reading 2°C: Beyond The Limit, the interests of local business are often decisive in determining local elections. And I really do agree with the opinion of Edward France, the former executive director of the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition. According to him, we’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something. People usually like to weigh the trade-offs when it comes to environment and development, but I guess the economic trade-offs would be easier to bear from a national perspective than on a local level. 
<br><br>


Another thing from the reading that has caught my attention is that, before the fire and flood, people in Santa Barbara “thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world--something important but remote.” I agree with this statement, and I resonate a lot with the article, particularly because I live in Santa Barbara now. Reading about how Thomas Fire destroyed the houses and took away some people and how sea level rise led to the disappearance of cliffs, as well as getting emergency alerts and seeing the Cave Fire last November, I know that climate change is closely related to my life.



</p><hr>


<p>

The article, “2ºC: Beyond the limit” by Scott Wilson acted as a reality check. It’s exactly what Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das William stated in the article: “Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote.” This is such an easy mindset to fall into, but reading an article that puts into realistic terms a happening of a natural disaster, using familiar pronouns, like the name of your city, your university, the small little beach town of Isla Vista that you inhabit, it truly makes you stop and think that this is reality. It’s a story being published in a major newspaper! It’s quite confuddling to question why, even though I witnessed the Thomas Fire and was surrounded by news of the mudslides and Cave Fire, why it’s so easy to forget the impact of those natural disasters a month, two months after it happens… 
<br><br>

Another thought I became aware of after reading this article was how everytime I bike on DP (Del Playa Drive), I see the mountain-side homes blur past me and wonder when these homes will become the ocean-side homes, how the infrastructure of these houses will be changed since the front of the homes will be facing the cliff. At first, I thought it might be due to natural erosion, but the article made me realize that the rising sea levels definitely accelerate the process of cliff erosion. Climate change is literally happening in my backyard.

I think you bring up a really interesting point of how we can so easily forget the disasters that happen. The CampFire happened only merely a year ago, yet I feel like so much time has passed since then. I remember being on Twitter and reading about how technology speeds up our perception of time. It discussed something along the lines of having access to so many things that are happening and have shorter attention spans, time tends to go by faster. Hence, we forget about the past and focus more on the now. From Youtube tea to impeaching Trump, events happen everyday, so we are focusing from thing to thing if that makes sense. I also enjoy how you tied it back to something that we can all physically see. I never really thought about how the mountain-side homes can eventually become ocean-side due to the acceleration of cliff erosion, which was a topic I was aware of. Finally, I agree that it is a very easy mindset to fall into because I have found myself in that mindset many times. However, after taking global warming and enrolling in this class, I feel more and more aware of the detrimental effects that are going to happen if we do not actively take action.

Mr. Scott Wilson has done a great job introducing the climate change issues near the Santa Barbara area. The very first picture regarding the temperature change in California clearly illustrates which region has the highest temperature increase. The Santa Barbara county, unfortunately, has a temperature increase of around 3 degrees Celcius. Due to rising temperatures, the wildfire has been hitting California more frequently and more viciously. 
<br><br>


While I am writing this comment, there are countless numbers of wildlife in Australia suffering and dying in the bushfire season which started in June 2019. An estimated one billion animals and 29 people have been killed. And 46 million acres of land is damaged. After all of this, we might still fail to stop the murder, global warming from hurting other beings. 

<br><br>

Apart from the wildfire, the rising temperature accelerates the formation of ocean tornados. When cold dry air from Canada meets the hot moist air above the Pacific Ocean, they circulate with each other and merge into a huge tornado. While the temperature change map of California State only concerns about the hot areas on land, a similar map about ocean temperature might be helpful to predict where a tornado is most likely to be born.

As I read the article, it came almost as shocking to me that Santa Barbara, despite its reputation as being environmentally progressive, is not doing nearly enough to combat the issue of climate change. And it's baffling because Santa Barbara neither lacks the financial resources nor the solutions to this issue. There are always big talks, conventions, protests going on about future plans but where are the concrete steps taken to reach those goals?
<br><br>
It's terrifying to me because Santa Barbara is known as a dream destination for wealthy people and is known for its own wealthy neighborhoods, ad if a place with so much wealth is not doing its part, then how do we hold the rest of the world accountable for their actions in regard to their impact on the environment?
<br><br>
As the article mention, the climate crisis is hitting closer to home now more than ever; people are forced to evacuate from their home, farms are burning, animals are dying, the cliffs in IV are disappearing... what does it take for people to realize they need to walk the talk and enforce the necessary policies instead of riding on empty promises?
<br><br>
It's funny the article mentions that free parking is a god giving right Santa Barbarans believe in.Taking away free parking reduces the number of cars on the street, it's that simple, but that is not being done, due to what businesses claim as "profitability," but the fact is that the car is the biggest contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and businesses need to get it straight. And I've learned that it can be hard for people to go through their everyday lives thinking about the environmental impact of every single one of their decision, and that makes it even more necessary for these policies to become a reality. Until then, people need to keep it in mind that for the rest of the world, it is their god given right to live on this earth without fear of their homes getting destroyed or taken away from them, and we are all responsible for making that a reality, or at least not making it worse.

It is interesting how scarier climate change seems to a lot of people when it begins to affect their nearby area. The fires, drought, and sea level rise occurring in Santa Barbara is just a preview of what is going to happen, and worse, in the future. I always thought of Santa Barbara as a very sustainably conscious place, until I read about the disparity between the ideals of the city versus the actions. The government in Santa Barbara has been lacking at following their antipollutant goals and often give in to the interests of local businesses and the fuel industry, because it was what brings in their money. This issue is the prime reason why not enough climate change action is being taken across the world: money. Their Climate Action Plan has no actual way to regulate businesses and they only do emissions reports every 3 years. Without enforcement of policies, there will be no change. And with no change Santa Barbara will continue to experience houses falling into the ocean, farmers losing their crops and livestock to intense heat, massive fires that also cause power to be cut off, and oil spills. This article made me sad to see what is happening to Santa Barbara because I now consider it a home. With some of the highest temperature rises, at 2.3 degrees C, we are just going to be more susceptible to tragic events unless action is taken. Another thing I found interesting was the impact of urbanization in Los Angeles affecting these areas. I think that is public transportation was improved and there were incentives to drive less, we would see at least a slowing to the accelerating rates of pollution and warming. Santa Barbara should be called out for not doing enough to mitigate the issues going on in their area and the people of Santa Barbara need to demand local officials to make these changes.

As an international student in the US, it’s surprising that California, one of the biggest and most popular states, has suffered from plenty of catastrophes and terrible climate changes. That is to say, it probably will no longer be the most beautiful and safe state to live in. In addition to that this must make the residents feel insecure to stay.
<br><br>


The article “2 degrees beyond the limit” explains how the rising temperature in California has been bringing inevitable consequences to the places and people. The most severe event that happened in 2017 was the Thomas Fire with burning of more than 281,000 acres, which Ken also mentions in the video. 40 million residents in California are living in the risk of fire. Their houses are destroyed and hillsides are collapsed in which all contributed to the massive wildfire of the forests. I believe what Ken states should make people feel cautious and curious about this issue since it’s not just the responsibilities of the environmentalists but also people who claim to be a part of the state. 
<br><br>


In particular, Santa Barbara's country has been currently suffering from these natural disasters. The most alarming fact is that the cliffs beside Del Playa Street in Isla Vista have been covered by the rising sea. As a UCSB student, I’m kind of shocked by this. I think one solution to this problem would be planting more trees to absorb carbon dioxide so that the sea will not rise that fast. On the other side, the government policy of ending parking lots is a wise choice. Since air pollution provides plenty of CO2, the described method can slowly reduce it.

What resonated most with me from the article were the points made about aesthetics over action, "poser" environmentalism, and plans with no teeth. I find it shameful that Santa Barbara, cradle of the environmental movement and home to a wide breadth of environmental scholars and activists, is lagging in environmental policy while at the same time warming at an alarming rate. I was surprised to learn about the ineffectiveness of the Santa Barbara government concerning reducing environmental impact. I had this image in my mind of Santa Barbara as an environmental utopia, but I guess I didn't realize the impact tourism and commutes have on local greenhouse gas emissions. I feel like poser environmentalism is a major problem as well. Many people (including governments and companies) talk the talk but don't walk the walk when it comes to environmentalism. If a government appears to be environmentally friendly, it can both appease its constituents and continue unsustainable growth. The plans with no teeth section particularly resonated with me. This is a sentiment I encounter quite often in my own education. I am an environmental studies major and often find myself frustrated in class when we are discussing potential solutions to problems that are either extremely surface level or I know are impossible to implement, or just won't be implemented due to lack of political will. The other thing I thought of when reading the article is if any research has been done to see if the existing oil infrastructure in the central coast could be converted to solar infrastructure and still be profitable for companies to operate. As someone alluded to in class today, making renewables profitable may be a way for fossil fuel companies to switch over their infrastructure.

I think the most important part of this article is that it illuminates how climate change has very real effects that are quite literally taking place in our own backyard. When I hear people discuss climate change, I feel like they often discuss its consequences in other parts of the world and brush over the fact that it is affecting our country. Many even refuse to accept that disasters such as wildfires are the product of climate change. I believe if more people directly attributed the climate crisis to the multitude of natural disasters our state has been facing they would make a more conscious effort to live a more sustainable life. It seems like when people focus on the consequences of climate change in other countries, they are less inclined to make changes in their lifestyle because they don’t see themselves as victims of the crisis, perpetuating an out of sight out of mind mentality about the whole situation. This is problematic because it not only hinders progress but in a way defers the responsibility of remedying the crisis to other countries. We saw this same mentality in last week’s reading and videos. I think a major contributor to this mentality is the enormity of the climate crisis. It is a worldwide disastrous event and unfortunately for most people it just seems easier to not think about it.

I am not surprised that Ken said fewer and fewer people ask him when climate change will start. It is becoming more prevalent in peoples’ everyday lives. It is fascinating to me that Ventura County has had to highest temperature rise in the lower 48 states. This shows how close to home the issue hits because we are only about 45 minutes away from there. It surprises me that Ventura County has had the greatest rise. It makes me wonder how and why a generally temperate climate has been affected the most. Especially because I thought that the poles and along the equator (the two extremes) were affected the worst. It is ironic how California is the most environmentally conscious state and yet has seen the greatest temperature rise from Climate Change. This shows that even the state that is the most progressive and willing to change isn't even doing enough. It makes me wonder how people will be able to cope with the upcoming changes our future holds. Especially Americans, who, generally, are extremely set in their ways and addicted to their lavish lifestyles. I think that even though there is a lot of controversy now regarding climate change, it is only going to get worse and people are going to get really upset about having to change.

I'm shocked by the fact that Santa Barbara is the city with fastest rising rate of temperature in the U.S.. Just as Ken, I thought Santa Barbara was a place like paradise with very little climate impact. However, I was totally wrong. In the article “2 degrees beyond the limit”, the author listed various terrible events happened just in Santa Barbara during recent decades and the behaviors of local people. For roughly 100 years, the temperature here has warmed by 2.3 degrees. 2.3 seems to be a small number, but the life here totally changed. Marine plants and animals near the shore were threatened by the growing heat and loss of moisture. Besides, the occurrence of wildfire also increased. The farmers here even changed to grow more tropical crops to reduce their lost. Increasing traffic may be the cause behind the scenes, but it will be very hard to solve the problem. We need to weigh the balance between environment and development. Looking out of the window, the sky of UCSB is still so pretty like before. However, I cannot appreciate its beauty now. I see the bitter history hidden behind the wonderful landscape. When will the paradise totally become the hell? We don’t know the answer. But judging from our current environmental protection measures, the date is not faraway.

The Thomas Fire started while I was in school in Washington during finals. I had received a text from my mom that they were under evacuation along with a picture of the flames engulfing the orchards near my house. In the meantime, my girlfriends house was surrounded by houses burning down and she was in the middle of evacuating animals. In Ojai, my aunts houses caught fire. I couldn’t focus on anything but home. My hometown was burning down, I was in the middle of finals, and I could do absolutely nothing about it other than read the updates made by VC Scanner. When I flew home that December, driving from LAX to Ventura, the smoke was as strong as could be. As a runner, I would run in the hills of Ventura. Runs that used to be in beautiful neighborhoods on the hillside were now plots of land with remnants of what used to be houses. I broke down.

<br><br>

While I am skeptical of the 2.6 degree rise in Ventura, I can confirm it has gotten warmer. Over the past five years, I have seen the damage of the climate crisis in Ventura. From the destruction of the botanical gardens, the boardwalk deteriorating slowly but surely, and just recently, a tornado touched down in the harbor. 

<br><br>

2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT showed me the path and thought processes of the future farmers for future crops. It also showed me that people all over the country and the world are needing to be prepared for our new normal of extreme disasters as a result of the climate crisis, and with this, we are needing to be more creative to alter the path to destruction.

In the “global weirding” section of this article, it discusses the event of July 6th, 2018 when a large pressure system in Colorado affected Southern California, specifically Santa Barbara. I was here in Santa Barbara on that day with my family. I had yet to start my first year at UCSB and we came down for orientation and turned it into a family vacation. At around 5pm, we were eating dinner on an outside patio at a restaurant on State Street. It was a warm night already, but suddenly it became almost unbearably hot. Right after we noticed to rapidly increasing heat, the wind kicked in. Hot and angry, it blew patio furniture around, knocked over umbrellas, and caused food to fly off tables. And as quickly as the aggressive wind flew in, it left. The patrons at the restaurant all sat in a state of disbelief, looking around at the destruction caused in just under a minute. We continued to eat our dinner (what hadn’t been blown off our plates and onto the floor) and then went back to our hotel. While coming into the hotel, we started talking to the man at the front desk who had been a Santa Barbara resident for over 30 years. He had never seen anything like that in all the time he had lived here. That’s when I felt a twinge of anxiety, that this is not normal. Reading this article and discovering that these “global weirding” events are becoming more common unsettled me. I will likely be moving away from Santa Barbara after I graduate, but my parents have decided to relocate here next year permanently, for many of the reasons stated in the article. This made me worry for their safety. Will they be threatened by fires like many residents have been recently? This article highlights the closeness of the climate change crisis, that is is happening here and it is happening now. It is no longer a future scenario affecting other parts of the world. Growing up in California my whole life, “wildfire season” was always something we had to be aware of. But the season is stretching longer and longer and we are being sent into a perpetual state of inferno.

 I totally agree with your point and I think the earth is currently under the "global weirding". The extreme weather is all over the world.For example the LA wildfire, Australia big fire...and I found there are more and more disasters in the world in the recent years.The LA wildfire have burn all the way to the Santa Barbara, I witnessed that the fire myself. Moreover the wildfire in the Australia have killed millions animals, it destroyed the natural balance of the Australian ecology. And I guess the disaster would become more and more as the time goes, if our human still ignoring the pollution and environmental problems. Reading this "global weirding" article woke me up. I think we need to bring more people watching this video and engage into our discussion. If we still being numb on these environmental issues, one day it's going to kill us all.

In “Beyond the limit” Scott Wilson discusses events throughout California to place emphasis on climate change and its looming consequences. He mentions the already-present “intense wildfires, deadly mudslides and prolonged extreme drought” to make his audience aware that climate change is here and it can only get worse if changes are not made in our lifestyles and in policies. His approach is very informative but also invokes a lot of pathos, especially for students in the Isla Vista area. It’s crazy to think that these same balconies we dance on, beaches we play in, cliffs we watch the sunsets from could be gone or even slightly different from how we see them now because of climate change. When Wilson wrote this article, it is clear what his intentions were: California is on a path of destruction. And while people like Terri Bowman, a manager at a camping resort, has made protocols to deal with the fires that come with climate change, it still does not stop the fact that it will get worse. Thinking about this, it’s interesting to see how people are making changes to combat climate without actually dealing with the problem itself: making changes in our own lives that will positively impact the environment. Not saying that I am not a part of the problem too. I mean earlier today I bought a plastic water bottle at the arbor. Climate change is scary and while we can make changes in our actions, it will be hard. Someone in the comments mentioned how meat could be a positive impact but doing that is hard, and I completely agree. Some things we are just too accustomed to and changing our diet is harder if you cannot see direct results from doing so. 
<br><br>

Nonetheless, I think this article was very necessary because it specifically calls out real-life events that are happening as a direct consequence of climate change, things that we can fix in our lifetime. Fires are getting worse, and they're spreading to areas that were once unfamiliar to its ravage. While I do have hope that we can address specific issues that could reverse the clock, doing so would, unfortunately, take something drastic because some people do not feel the negative impacts of climate change yet and therefore continue to live the life they're already accustomed to. I often catch myself doing the same thing but being aware and understanding that climate change is not a hoax I think influences the small decisions I unconsciously make.

I, too, noticed that this article hit much closer to home than anything I've seen or read in this course so far, since it describes what's happening so close to home. Before this article, I still considered climate change "'important but remote'", but this has changed my mind. When deciding where to go to college, I was constantly reminded to be aware of the natural disasters in the Santa Barbara area. Now I understand that this is likely due to global warming. It is never easy to imagine something far away and abstract, but we experience the horrible effects of climate change in our very backyard. It is very concerning that natural disasters have pretty much become an "'annual event'" i where we all live. The Cave Fire was concerning enough, but we were far enough away that it didn't threaten anyone on campus. I worry about the next natural disaster when we may not get as lucky. It's almost embarrassing that Santa Barbara preaches climate awareness but has done little itself. People's minds need to be changed before all of Santa Barbara burns down. We live in one of the most vulnerable towns in the country with respect to climate change, which may be why so many of us are adamant about saving the environment. However, words mean little when there are no actions to back them up. Let's set an example for not just the country, but the world.

It was very crazy to me to hear that the neighboring city, Ventura has raised by 2.6 degrees. Making it the fastest warming area in the lowest 40 states. Along with this, the fact that ¼ of California residents are at risk of fires. For me it is crazy to think of how unshocking fires have become. Over the past years I have seen so many fires while driving south towards La and all over social media, they have become a normal event. Thankfully I have not dealt with them personally. But I cannot imagine all the people and especially farmers who have. Not only do farmers lose their homes in fires, but they lose all their work and products. While reading I was really shocked to learn about the one farmer in particular who paid over $100,000 to keep his plants and livestock safe. Little did he know, when he would turn the switch nothing happened, because power was shut off. Hearing this was really sad to me, not only the money lost, but I cannot imagine his reaction when he went to turn it on and nothing happened. All hope this man had was instantly lost. Along with this article said that many people were left with questions after the major fires. Like what the state could do to help what all these people lost. But what could the state do? 
 <br><br>
Another factor that the article brought up was how all of these animals are affected by the warming. Knowing that desert species have decreased by 43% is huge, almost half… Another factor that I was shocked by was that 13 whales had swum up in one year in San Francisco alone. To continue on with effects on the ocean was the effects of sea level rise. Seeing the pictures of what is happening to the beaches on Del Playa was crazy, especially because it is only going to get worse. And that by 2060 78% of the cliffs could be gone. The college town that the past and I know of will quickly be gone due to this.

"2C: Beyond the Limit" brought to my attention that many real people are being affected by the global climate change. I feel like before reading this article, I disassociated myself from the people being impacted because I didn't know them personally. However, the article reminded me again that we should care for one another as a society, in order to move forward to end climate change. Nowadays it's easy to ignore how climate change effects others because we're so consumed in our own lives, but we have to remember that this is a long term problem that we all must make steps to solve. Santa Barbara is the home of farmers, home owners, students, and everyone in between. The city, and residents, should enact policies that prioritizes environment over profit. Many people view our city as a vacation destination and even the start of the environmental movement. Santa Barbara is a beautiful place that should be preserved. The growing wildfires, rising sea levels, and temperature change has been threatening Southern California. They are occurring so often that is seem as normal but this isn't normal. Real life people, like Professor Hiltner, are being effected by these environmental changes. We must be proactive in stopping the escalation of the environmental changes.

I was the same as you before I read the article “2°C: Beyond the limit.” Before, I would hear and read about all these climate changes going on all around the world and be somewhat dissociated from it. I would feel bad for what is happening to our earth but because it was happening in places far away from me I never really worried about it affecting me. After reading the article and listening to Ken talk about the alert he received over the winter break it made me realize that these changes are actually happening before my eyes where I live (Northern California) and where I go to school (UCSB).  It is important people, including myself of course, stop being passive about the changes currently going on.

Although I have read many articles on climate change before, reading "2ºC: Beyond the Limit" impacted me in a more personal way. A lot of the previous articles I have read talk about general places worldwide which is understandable, but with this article it affected me personally since it  focused on Santa Barbara County, which is where I currently live now and lived when the Thomas Fire occurred. In addition, when the article talked about one of the apartments falling off the cliff, I remember one of my friends posting about needing housing in the middle of the school year since half of her apartment just fell into the ocean. Reading this article opened up my eyes even more that climate change is happening right now where I live. It's not just solely happening in another country or in another state or just nearby in California. It's happening where I live and where everyone else lives. There isn't a group of people immune to climate change, and for those who need to "see it to believe it," if we continue down the path we've been taking, more and more locations on the planet will be able to see/live through the effects of climate change.

 <br><br>

In addition, seeing that Santa Barbara is seen as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, yet falling short of its own antipollution goals is very disappointing and unsettling. Like the article said, "If Santa Barbara's predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?" This quote definitely caused me to feel hopeless. With all the climate change deniers and companies/people who partake in environmentally dangerous actions due to greed (money+fossil fuel addition) it can hard to be optimistic about where our planet is heading.

I found the article “2ºC: Beyond the limit” astonishing. While I have been aware of climate change for quite some time, I had no idea it was having such a profound effect right in our backyard. I think what really hit home for me was the estimate by 2060, 78% of the properties on the cliffs of DP will be gone. I myself will be living on DP next year, and have always admired the opportunity to live so close to the ocean. To think that most won't have that chance in the future brings me great sadness, and i just hope we can be better and prevent this.

Although I agree that this is a sad statistic and it is hard to imagine that DP will one day be lost, I feel that you may be missing the much more critical scope of this issue. The way that you are considering the climate crisis is the reason that people are refraining from taking action. The way the people consider only what is going to affect them in this horrific change of climate is why many are not taking action. Because many feel that the worst that can happen to them is not having "the opportunity to live so close to the ocean," like how you feel about DP,  many will not take steps to change because this does not worry them nearly enough. Instead of focusing on such a trivial issue in terms of a world wide disaster, you should try to understand more about the effect it will have on others less privileged than you.

"2°C: Beyond the Limit" really brought to light the "all talk, no game" of Santa Barbara County's stance on the climate crisis. Since I had mostly heard about the great ways UCSB was implementing sustainability, I assumed that the rest of Santa Barbara had similar ideas; however, after reading this article, it seems like almost the opposite. "Promises" have been made to reduce fossil fuel emissions in order to move towards renewable sources of energy, yet almost no progress, if not regression, occurs instead. Although the outstanding temperature rise in Santa Barbara County can be attributed to several factors, it is no excuse to stray from the plans set in place that would undoubtedly help the county's environment.
 <br><br>


Another thing this article brought to light for me, but more so surprised me, was the effects Santa Barbara's climate is having on the local agricultural industry. I had little knowledge that an extreme lack of freshwater was causing farmers to completely change which crops they grew. Although I think it is a bit exciting that these farmers can grow things they couldn't before, like dragonfruit, it makes me ponder how climate change could heavily influence people's diets moving forward. In 100 years will California's main crop be agave? In 100 years will fruits like avocado be scarce here? How the ag industry may evolve could cause several problems much more severe than just the problems farmers are facing today in swapping crops to grow.

It is very interesting that you are wondering how our diets will shift because of climate change, which also makes me wonder to what degree will climate change reduce our food production due to water scarcity and increase salinity. Also, I think that it is fortunate for the farmers in the reading to be able to grow dragon fruits, because I remember from the film Before the Flood that some farm lands in Indian are flooded and people lost a large amount of their crops.

It is truly crazy how Southern California was once a place with mild and predictable weather, and as Ken mentioned, a “locus amoenus.” However, now the weather is becoming hotter and hotter every single day, and is causing deadly wildfires and other unforeseen natural disasters. It really is terrifying that the coastal curve along Southern California is apparently warming “at double the rate of the continental United States;” the article also mentions how this pace is continuing to accelerate year after year.
 <br><br>
With the average Santa Barbara county warming by 2.3 degrees Celsius, the situation is already well past the danger zone, because the Paris accords concluded that the average warming should be below 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic consequences. 
 <br><br>
The scariest part to hear was when the article mentioned the detrimental effects warmer climate has to our oceans. The ocean is warming to such an extent that “oyster, crab, and urchin harvests” are in disarray. It’s even more depressing to hear that thirteen whales washed ashore dead in the San Francisco Bay, and marine biologists discovered that the reason why they died is due to an empty stomach. That really is sad to hear; the ocean was once an ecosystem that teemed with plentiful ocean life, and now whales are dying because there is a lack of food.
 <br><br>
I liked how this article focused mainly on the climate crisis in Southern California, specifically in Goleta and Santa Barbara, so that it gave us a greater insight into the crisis as UCSB students. I also liked how the article incorporated other students’ testimonies to further underscore the negative impact of climate change. For example, the article talked about a case where the beaches along Del Playa Drive could be claimed up to 78% by erosion by 2060. Because most of the cliffs crumbled into the water, there had to be signs attached to the fence to warn people to keep their distance. 
 <br><br>
Overall, the article was extremely impactful, and I was personally able to sympathize a lot more with the potential negative effects that can occur due to the climate crisis to Santa Barbara, Goleta, Ventura County, and the rest of California. It truly is scary to think that many of our cliffs along our school are slowly being claimed by erosion, and the places that we would always go to to enjoy the view could one day disappear.

I was always taught to be very grateful for what I had, but in turn, I was growing up in this bubble where I knew there were bad things going on in the world but I never thought I had any power to do anything about it. 
 <br><br>

I’ve always been grateful to be in California because of its weather. When I was younger, I remember having a 95℉ Christmas day being okay with it because at least I wasn’t on another coast where hurricanes were taking over. Nothing bad could happen in California - it was the dream land. As I grew older, it got worse. My friends and I were driving home from the beach and saw the hills of Nipomo on fire - but thank goodness none of us lived there. I visited UCSB and heard of all the erosion happening on the cliffs and the sea levels rising - but thank goodness I wasn’t planning on living right next to the beach. There’s droughts in California - but thank goodness I’m privileged to have water. Once I got to UCSB and took my first earth class I learned quickly that these “bad things” were the climate changing, and it was only about to get worse. 
 <br><br>

It catches up to you quickly. You’re living a happy life in a bubble walking on the beach when you encounter the horrific sight of beached sea lions. You start to wonder why it’s getting so hot in the winter. Then you wake up to tornado warnings IN SANTA BARBARA. What are they doing out here???
 <br><br>

Anywho, the bubble’s been shattered. I can see the terrible things going on and I know it has something to do with CO2. I was proved that there’s bad things going on everywhere around me. I guess now I’m just excited to learn how I have the power to do something about it.

In the article "2 C: Beyond the Limit" by Scott Wilson, he explains the plethora of issues that are happening right here in Santa Barbara. From forest fires to cliff erosion, he emphasizes to big changes that have happened in recent years. The effect of the article hits closer to home because I've seen the forest fires, have been evacuated twice already, and my friends live on the ocean eroded cliffs that were talked about in the article. It's so startling to see the massive changes that are happening right in our own backyards and the things that we heard about since we were kids are now right on our front door step almost literally. It makes me sad to think that the most gorgeous place I've ever lived in (the coast, not Isla Vista) is being torn down and ruined by human activity. Seeing all the effects of human activity is a powerful scene as I've seen the fires, I've seen the cliff erosion, and I've seen the oil covered beaches and the many oil rigs that dot the horizon. I heard about the massive crack that allowed 3 million barrels of oil into our oceans but I never made the connection that it was right here where I now live. It made me think about all the people that don't live where we live. How seemingly distant these problems seem and the issues seems abstract because it isn't happening where they live. 
 <br><br>


This article was very beneficial to my understanding of climate change and general human activity. Collecting all the problems that are affecting the environment and throwing it right in my face was a wake up call as It really has had an impact on my life as these issues are directly affecting me as well. Perhaps it isn't the most selfless reason to notice and care but it did shock me. The problem is much bigger then people realize.

<p>
This article was a bit of shock for me. Before reading the article “2C beyond the limit”, I haven’t realized how close we actually are in this climate crisis issue. The truth is, turned out, we are currently at the middle of a severe climate change that would affect everyone’s life in the state of California. According to the lecture, “Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius”, fires and droughts occurred due to this problem and many were affected. 
 <br><br>
There were four major fires occurred during these ten years and every one of them had a considerably large perimeter. I believe the major problem is that people live in California are used to wild fire. “A quarter of California’s 40 million residents now live in high-risk fire zones.” That is a great number, at least it is to me. So many lives are in potential danger and yet there are many believe wild fire are part of the nature systems. They are taking this as an excuse for not taking any action to make this situation better. However, what they do not know is that many are caused by ourselves, it was due to the rise in the average temperature and this is not natural and can’t be considered as part of the nature. There is news about large wild fire every year on the news, and many caused enormous amount of loss to the environment and people. I think this article can be used as an alarm for many people.

 I definitely agree that the article was a big shock. Well, all of the content in the class thus far has been eye-opening to me. One major fact that Ken pointed out in his video is that California is responsible for producing around 50% of the United State’s fruits and nuts. With increasing occurrences of natural disasters such as fires and storms, this could potentially be detrimental to the U.S. population’s diet. Yet, no one is alarmed or even paying attention at this point. Personally, I previously thought that California was just home to wildfires because that’s all I’d heard about it growing up. We got fires and earthquakes, while the rest of the world got storms and floods. However, it’s only been prevalent in recent years, making so much of California “high-risk fire zones.” Looking into the Paradise and Thomas fires, it’s clear that things are only worsening. This climate crisis itself is such a complex, yet simple situation. Rather than facing what we’re really facing, people turn away with ignorance. I’ve heard so many people say “we’ll let the next generation figure it out.” I think this statement is extremely selfish. We’re continuing a domino effect that was created by Ken’s generation. By doing nothing, we are helping this crisis flourish and evolve even more. Isn’t sitting idly by and watching as bad as doing the deed? It may be so. I understand that ignoring the situation is easier than taking steps to mitigate it. But if we let this continue, there’s no saying what the future may hold.

It’s crazy to think that over break a tornado would have hit Santa Barbara and all of us that left for winter break would have come back to see the disaster that could’ve been. I myself wasn’t aware of this till Ken said it in class the other day and I can’t imagine how terrified the people who live here were when the tornado warning hit, considering this is a “pleasant place” as the Ken stated the ancient romans called it. This left me questioning, will this be a normal occurrence now? Or was it just a one-time thing.  
 <br><br>

Aside from the tornado warning, this past year there was a fire that could be seen from Santa Catalina Hall and as the day went on it kept growing and people who were closer to it had to be evacuated from their homes. Luckily the fire department got it under control and put it out before any further damage could be done. This event came to mind when I read the part of the article where many people lost their investment in crops and livestock due to the fires. It also brought attention to how our produce can be affected if areas become drier and more prone to fires, due to temperature increase. An example of this from the article is what happened to La Paloma ranch, they harvested mainly avocados (which is a water intensive plant) but when the temperature increased and the amount of water they had available decreased, causing them to lose a lot of the crops. La Paloma ranch now harvests dragon fruit, agave etc. Which are not as dependent on water. If the temperature keeps increasing, will the majority of plants that places like La Paloma ranch harvest not be able to grow here anymore?

The article “2°C: Beyond the limit” written by Scott Wilson mainly talks about intense wildfires in California. The weather in Southern California is used to be mild and predictable, but the climate grows hotter and drier these years. Some regions are suffered from intense wildfires, deadly mudslides and prolonged extreme drought. People living on the mountains are affected badly. Their houses were burned down, and they have to pay extra money and live at the hotels. They lost their properties, more seriously, their lives.

 <br><br>

In Santa Barbara, the situation is even worse. The Thomas Fire in December 2017 was the first sign that Santa Barbara’s climate had changed and that wildfires had become more severe. To my great surprise, it burned 281,000 acres, and heavy rains a month later killed 23 people. The report found that, rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Santa Barbara was actually exceeding its 2007 levels by 14 percent in 2015.
 <br><br>


There are some plans to fix these problems, but the rules are just words on paper. No one is there to enforce the rules. People are never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something. Thus, as far as I am concerned, to stop climate change or to limit the rising temperature below 2℃ needs a joint effort of the government and citizens in California. In order to save our planet, we need more governors who really care about environment, but not benefits from business. Also, it would be effective if everyone takes an action in everyday life. For example, reducing use of cars, saving paper and electricity are definitely useful. Or otherwise, people will have nowhere to relax during vacations.

The fact that this article is mainly about Santa Barbara makes the issue of climate change that much more personal. Of course hearing about the ice melting in Antartica is tragic but when we are experiencing climate change right where we are, it feels a lot different. I heard about the Paris agreement in Before the Flood and had no idea that the Santa Barbara area has already exceeded the threshold. (Also screw Trump for wanting to leave he is the biggest idiot on the face of this Earth.) This growing heat is threatening our coastal redwood forest and Joshua tress of the southern desert. The fire and rains in the Santa Barbara county caused 23 deaths and $2 billion in damage. The good thing that came from the climate problems was that people began to realize how big of an issue this was, not only for countries on the other side of the planet but right in their backyard. Even though Santa Barbara may have started the “modern environmental movement” it really isn’t doing much to accomplish its goals or serving as as model to others. 
  <br><br>
California’s overall target was to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero over the next 25 years. I think that that is a great goal to aim for but what exactly has California done to move forward and meet this goal. The country pledged to reduce emissions by %15 and Santa Barbara actually exceed the levels by %14. Santa Barbara tries to come off as so environmentally ahead of everyone and progressive but it really is fake. The reason that these regions are heating up so fast is because of the urbanization and all the traffic on the highways.

After reading, “2℃: Beyond the Limit”, I was surprised to learn that Santa Barbara is also experiencing its impacts from climate change in unusual ways. I always thought (naively) that places like Santa Barbara, Ventura, and other coastal places were going to be the last places to feel any type of fire/drought event, definitely experience sea rise levels but certainly not fires. I was proven wrong with the Thomas Fire, Cave Fire, mudslides, tornadoes. The reason I didn’t expect Santa Barbara to be a target of climate change this quickly was due to how clean and eco-friendly it is compared to other places such as LA. However, living in LA for almost 18 years and 2 years here at UCSB, it makes sense that I couldn’t see how climate change is affecting every city in its own different way. For example, in the article it states, “Despite Santa Barbara’s heritage as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, the country is falling far short of its own antipollution goals, which are meant to serve as a model for others to follow”. This really makes you think how even the people who claim to help and care for the environment are also struggling to find ways to consistently help because climate change is moving faster than we expected. As a student here at UCSB, my parents are worried about all the natural disasters that could occur at any moment and now I strongly understand their concerns. A strong earthquake can hit at any moment which can cause a tsunami, sea level can rise very rapidly, the cliffs could fall, a wild fire could spread, and now we have to watch out for tornadoes too. Even though I could be exaggerating these events, it never hurts to think ahead and have a plan in case these things do happen. Furthermore, what captured my attention the most out of the article was when I read the quote, “Warming here already has exceeded the threshold set in the 2015 Paris climate accords, which President Barack Obama joined and the Trump administration has promised to leave”. It is infuriating to know that the person in power and control to mitigate the problem of climate change is only exacerbating it. It makes sense considering that the “president” is part of the generation that doesn’t consider climate change is to be real. This is why it is extremely important for our generation, who is now old enough to vote, to vote for a candidate who is environmentally aware of what is going on around us and how we don’t have much time to wait. The U.S is a nation that influences other nations and if we can just start taking action now, maybe others will too and we could be in time to limit the consequences of climate change.

I too have been found guilty of thinking that climate change can wont affect me. I live in a beautiful Mediterranean pleasant place and my ignorance thought , "Why should I be the one to suffer from global warming." No longer can we as a community be blind to what is happening to our world and our home. Now, I realize the harshness of mother nature will not stop for anyone or anyplace. Fires, oil spills, mud slides, earthquakes (followed by tsunamis), and now tornadoes are in our backyard. The short term future has much more disasters if we keep overusing earths resources. Natural disasters, more like man-made monstrosities. I am not saying that we should all point our fingers at the oil industry for creating category 6 hurricanes. However, humans are the cause of this epidemic, so why not be the ones to end it. I learned in kindergarten that we are suppose to clean up our own messes. So we owe it to all life forms, already negatively effected and suffering, to fix this problem before it spirals out of control at the turning point where earth will begin to warm itself.

This article was very relatable and a little to close for comfort. For someone who will live on DP in the coming years, thinking that by 2060, 78% of properties will be eaten by the eroding cliff is scary. As someone who is trained not to get too close to the edge, I wish the waterfront houses would know better too. Some more memorable points include a quarter of Americans live in fire zones with high risk. Half of America's nuts, fruits, and vegetables rely on California's farmland, and at the rate of fires spreading, there is reason to worry. The days in certain regions peak at 115 degrees Fahrenheit. The rising heat threatens redwood trees with lack of moisture. In the California deserts, 43% of species are dead. And to top it off, conditions are going to get worse before they get better. This class is not only changing my viewpoints on global warming, but I'm starting to change my lifestyle, become more spiritual and do good for the world, not just in it.

While Scott Wilson's "2°C: Beyond the limit" was a well-written article that balanced facts with personal testimonies,  it left me feeling frustrated. The effects of climate change in California are indisputably horrible. Fires, deadly temperatures, and a loss of economic stability due to droughts and crop failures are becoming a way of life now. We obviously need to prepare for the escalation of climate change—days are only going to get hotter, fires will be bigger, and only heartier, drought-resistant crops will be able to survive in the coming decades, as farmers in Wilson's article claimed. California, between its population, location, and existing changes in climate, is going to continue to bear a large burden in the coming decades. The climate crisis is already dramatically altering our lives, and everyone is going to have to adjust. But we are not doing nearly enough to curb further emissions to prevent accelerating the problem, and that is what angers me so much.
  <br><br>

Senator Henry Stern is attributed as saying, "I feel like I am failing [my constituents]." As it is, Senator Stern is failing us. So is every other politician, both nationally and locally, when they fail to create comprehensive  climate change action plans without any method of enforcement. It may feel good to say that we can make a difference in the climate crisis by shopping local and secondhand, going vegan, and biking everywhere (not to knock these actions, I’m an avid thrifter, cyclist, and vegan) but what does any individual action matter if limits on the oil and fossil fuel industry continue to be struck down? The fact that 1.2 million acres of land in and around Santa Barbara County can be opened to the possibility of oil drilling and fracking in late 2019, even with the astronomical temperature rise, even after the fires that have occurred here for several years,  reveals a complete disinterest of the "progressive" polity here to actually do anything to preserve the environment--or more specifically, to preserve the local communities they govern.
  <br><br>

It’s not as if the fossil fuel industry hasn’t wrecked local havoc beyond the nebulous connection between decades-old fuel consumption and modern wildfires and increasing temperatures. As mentioned in the article, the 1969 Unocal oil spill in Santa Barbara has echoes that have lasted to the present day. It feels disingenuous to call ourselves “environmentally-friendly” and “Home of the Earth Day Movement” when we still sell out to the oil industry. As the event was mentioned by Wilson, I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone that the oil spill in 1969 (as well as the 1989 Exxon-Valdez and 2010 Deepwater Horizon spills) was not an accident. It was a violent crime against the environment caused by the negligence of the Union Oil Company. From the Geography department here at UCSB: “Union Oil's Platform A ruptured because of inadequate protective casing. The oil company had been given permission by the U.S. Geological Survey to cut corners and operate the platform with casings below federal AND California standards. Investigators would later determine that more steel pipe sheathing inside the drilling hole would have PREVENTED the rupture.” (Emphasis mine.) The government did not care about the environment then in 1969 and they do not care about it now. Only now, in 2020, it is not only our Earth that is at stake, it is us: our lives, our loved ones, our food production, our homes and schools, our livelihoods. The government will not change until we make them change. Businesses will not change until we make them change. When discussing the climate crisis, we need to remember that the people destroying our largest home have names, faces, fortunes, and seats in government.

It is one thing to know climate change is happening in countries far out of sight and out of mind, but it is another to see it happening in your own home. The extreme weather discussed in the Washington Post article was not anything unheard of or surprising, people have been talking about fires and irregular temperature since they have been happening. But what is unusual (to me at least) is seeing these weather patterns discussed as a direct result of anthropogenic climate change. Reading about the climate crisis specifically in my own city was a wake up call. When thinking about my own footprint I usually consider the impact on developing countries or the coral reefs, but after reading this article I am going to keep my own neighborhood in mind a lot more. Every time I use a car or buy a single use plastic, I am contributing to the destruction of the town I love so much. Beyond my individual footprint, it was frustrating to read so plainly that Santa Barbara is not the environmental role model that we like to pretend we are. Part of the reason I came to UCSB was the emphasis on sustainability and environmental activism, but now I realize our work is far from done. In the end, my takeaway from this reading was that if I want to keep my home safe and beautiful, I need to focus more energy on sustainable practices and more importantly, vote.

After reading the article, “2°C: Beyond the limit” by Scott Wilson. It appeared to me that humanity is not prepared for the devastating consequences of Climate Change. Moreover, even if humanity is prepared, will it be enough to sustain, protect, or prevent humanity from the terrors of nature?. As seen in the article, Larry Saarloos spent over more than $100,000 on systems like fire hydrants,new alarms, and advanced sprinklers to counter wildfires. Unfortunately, the whole system that Saarloos prepared was a complete flop due to equipment failure. The wildfires completely ravaged the whole vineyard area of Saarloos,creating smoke and airborne debris that caused an electrical fault. The whole scenario with Saarloos just questioned humanity’s readiness when “Doomsday” happens. In addition, I feel bothered to know the sad reality in which the apartments by the cliffs of Del Playa Drive are eroding in a quick rate and could be gone in a blink of an eye . As a student in UCSB, the photo that was presented to me in the article is a familiar place for me and my friends in Del Playa Drive to hangout and have some fun playing beach ball. The place is really amazing during sunset because of its marvelous view. Furthermore, I believe that we as students are lucky enough to be living around those “precious diamond” places, not knowing that anytime we could lose it. In fact, when Climate Change comes, we might not be prepared for it, who knows how annihilating nature could be?  

  <br><br>

 In the light of California’s agriculture, the whole nation is heavily reliant on the significant role of California’s cultivation. As seen in the lecture video of “2°C: Beyond the limit” by Ken Hiltner, California is responsible for a great portion of U.S. revenue when it comes to almost all fruits and nuts for the nation. Although this may be true, the state is still not safe from Climate Change. As seen in the article, the area of Ventura and even the place where most of us live, Santa Barbara, are not safe from climate change. Due to the consistent wildfires and unforgiving high temperature during winter, farmers are also in great toll when calamity hits, as they are currently having difficulties providing fruits and other vegetation to the market due to the unpredictable weather that California has been experiencing lately.  I thought that I was well aware that our water supply is running out, but I never thought the issue to be worse. For instance, farmers like Jay Ruskey used to cultivate his avocado orchard but because of the weather not being consistently warm and the limited supply of water, Ruskey needed to adapt and switch his plantation to dragon fruits and other crops that are tropical. Given that, Imagine not being in America, instead being in a poor country, people in those countries do not have sufficient resources for them to adapt and even, have the financial means to install advanced system like Saarloos, the damage they have to deal with because of climate change is surely desolating.

20 years ago people assumed that rising sea levels was the biggest threat that climate change poses on human life, but this is not the case anymore. Average temperatures in Southern California have been increasing immensely, and Ventura is named as the fastest growing county in the lower 48 states. And the warming here, in Southern California, has already exceeded the safe threshold. And the average increase in temperature around the globe is 1 degree C, which in hindsight does not sound like a huge change, but it is in-fact going to be detrimental if we continue on this path of increasing global temperatures. Climate scientists say that the global temperature cannot rise about 2 degrees C, and should stay well below this number; this is dangerous for our planet, because we are already at a 1 degree rise and are continuing to increase this number. For Californians climate change is directly affecting us; extreme weather travesties are happening every summer, wildfires. These fires are now becoming something we expect every summer, due to temperatures, and lack of rain, and with every year there is more and more and they become bigger and more intense. A large number of Californians live in high danger fire zones, making this problem real for many. The extreme weather caused by climate change in California is not only just wildfires or droughts, but we are starting to experience tornadoes, as Ken describes in this video. Growing up in California we practiced getting shelter for tornados, but never had to experience one or ever thought I would have to, but in fact this is becoming a reality for many residing in California. Climate change is not just going to affect temperature, or sea levels, but it will affect weather, and many other things that we may not even see coming right now; this crisis is like a sand hourglass, but once the sound runs outs we will not be able to flip it back over; the damage we are making we most likely will not be able to revert it.

After reading this article and listening to Ken’s lecture, one thing is certain: there is so much uncertainty when it comes to climate change and what to expect from its possible effects. I think this feeling of uncertainty causes a lot of anxiety amongst us because we are just not sure what to prepare for, what to expect, which leads to the uncertainty of what we are to do when it comes to how to help the climate crisis slow down (as I don’t see it realistic to claim, at this point in time, that we can ever stop the climate crisis); as Ken stated, it’s already here. The following quote from the article stuck out to me: : “’What we have seen is a complete lack of preparedness,’ said Trent Robbins, chief executive of Santa Barbara-based Global Power Supply, where customer calls for generator sales and rentals quadrupled in October. “This is like climate change writ small — you know it’s coming, but you are not preparing.” This quote stuck out to me because it makes me a little frustrated. The article points out the disasters happening, but I don’t think anyone is to blame or to be put down for not preparing for it; we don’t know what to prepare for. Living in CA, I always felt a sense of luck that I would never really have to worry about a tornado…however, last December opened my eyes and probably a lot of other people’s eyes. I think the scariest part of the climate crisis is knowing you are in danger, but never knowing what type of danger to prepare for. We can all think of worst case scenario, but you never really know if it’s actually the worst case scenario. All in all, this article made me feel more anxiety and I am excited for the weeks when we will be discussing what we can do to better adjust to the crisis and to hopefully slow it down…

Of all the points made in “2°C: Beyond the limit,” I found that this one to be the most impactful: The city’s legacy tells a story about how progressive it is on environmental matters,” said Leah Stokes, a political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, who specializes in energy and environmental politics. “But in our own backyard, we are not nearly as progressive as we think.”
  <br><br>
The article takes on the issue of planning vs. execution in regards to what the people of Santa Barbara are actually doing to improve climate change. I feel that this is an important topic to address. Santa Barbara, in a way, puts on a facade when it comes to being active around climate change. 
  <br><br>
 As the article puts it, if Santa Barbara--a place full of climate change activists--is not taking action, who will? 
  <br><br>
We again come upon the issue of people putting their wants first. When given the opportunity to vote in local elections, the people of Santa Barbara will chose a person who promotes business interests and free parking over someone who will implement Green-oriented regulations. What does this say about us as whole? 
  <br><br>
Even with a predominantly green electoral and political class, we are still not making the changes needed to prevent further climate damage. On the outside we put on an environmentally friendly face, but internally Santa Barbara is not climate change-oriented. 
  <br><br>

We are already seeing the affects of this. The Southern California coast is warming far faster than the rest of the world by a whooping 1.5°C. Fires rage in this region far more than any other. Temperatures reach extremes far more often. Our agricultural landscape is changing. Agricultural industries that once thrived are having to change their product in order to compensate for the dryness. Our ecosystem is changing. With warmer temperatures, ocean species are struggling. Santa Barbara must open its eyes to the hypocrisy of its green statements in order. for a change to occur.

I was also attracted by the statement made by the article that there was a gap between what the officials of Santa Barbara talk and their actions. As a foreign student coming to Southern California, I am deeply fascinated by the comfortable weather, plentiful palm trees and endless sunshine. It's heartbreaking to even imagine how catastrophic the fire will be in destroying these beautiful sceneries. As you have suggested, the weird weather pattern will negatively harm people's life in terms of agriculture, ecosystem and multiple aspects. It's crucial for us to take action by now instead of regarding it as "important but remote".
  <br><br>
I quite appreciate your point on the discussion of Santa Barbara's current process in respond to the rising temperature and climate crisis. Even though we start to envision the downsides of this temperature inversion, officials still don't take action or enforce policies to reduce the pollution little by little such as restricting the parking lots. Based on the article, urbanization and the busy traffic may be the possible factor contributing to air pollution and severe rising temperature. If the officials can gently make some acts and call on people to maintain an environmentally-friendly lifestyle, the climate will surly get benefited. Each generation should do something to preserve our planet and it depends on everyone's efforts.

At this point, after reading this article, nothing came as a complete shock to me. It brings me nothing but anger, confusion, and sadness when facing the fact that Santa Barbara, but not just this area, preaches as if they care about the escalating climate conditions and are working toward progressive implementations, but at the end of the day do not, and even contribute to the worsening conditions. If you are going to talk the talk, then walk the walk. I want to see action. I was so disappointed in reading that county officials were actually considering a proposal to allow fracking. I mean, that just sounds insane. Santa Barbara and its surrounding areas has seen the effects of the climate crisis in a way that one would assume they would take every single action and precaution in the book to move toward a solution. It really baffles me why these decisions are so hard to make, but at the same time it doesn’t. Money really rules the world and it shows. It has always had higher priority than caring about people’s lives. Honestly, I am not well educated about PG&E and their operations but anytime they say something it sounds like a whole lot of excuses and empty promises. Do better. 

  <br><br>

Reading through the comments, I see a lot of people mentioning that we always thought that California was this perfect little safe haven where the weather was sunny and bright and nothing could go wrong. It sure is sad to see just how wrong that statement is; now and for years. I continuously think about how it is a real possibility I may come back to visit UCSB and reminisce on my college years, to only be devastated that DP could be gone and washed away, with all of the housing and memories with it. I am at the point in this course where I am just so fed up with the lack of action that I want to quit school and be a vigilante and actively try to save our world. Unfortunately, that is just unrealistic. In the meantime, I can educate as many people as I can and hopefully persuade a few people to take the climate crisis more seriously.

Ventura County is my home. It’s where I grew up, and my heart is breaking after learning the fact that it’s the fastest warming county in the US. Sherpa Fire happened the summer before college started for me, so I was not aware of this catastrophe. Now looking back, the Real Fire occurred during my first quarter at UCSB, and I am disappointed in myself for not paying attention to my surrounding back then. However, I did notice the unusually heavy rains during the winter quarter of my freshman year. I remember having to bike in pouring rain with my friend all the way from FT to IV theater for our math class. We joked about sitting in the soaked cloth seats but thinking back the weather pattern that winter was oddly strange. 
  <br><br>

Anyhow, not only the local biodiversity is threatened, my family’s yearly sanctuary, Joshua Tree National Park, has also been deeply affected by climate change. I pray that my kids will be able to enjoy this family tradition. As an ecology and evolution major, one of my favorite classes is the vertebrate ecology lab. After spending every waking moment learning about birds, I’ve created a special bond with these flying creatures. I’m devastated to learn that their declining populations have been a consequence of climate-caused drought. As a local Santa Barbara resident, I haven’t gotten the chance to enjoy the breathtaking Channel Islands. Unfortunately, kelp forests around the Islands are depleting at an overwhelming rate. One thing I learned from my ecology classes is that kelp forests serve as the primary producer in the marine food web. Without them, the marine food web would be broken down, affecting all the organisms in the ocean. Consequently, top predators like whales are starving to death. 
  <br><br>

The first natural disaster that directly affected me was the Thomas Fire during my second year here. Having to evacuate right before finals was a nightmare. Finding out that one of my ex’s friends was one of 23 people killed in the mudslide that followed the devastating fire left me with no words. Perhaps, this tragedy served as a motivation for me to start attending the geology seminars at the Earth Science Department, so I could understand the aftermath of that particular mudslide in Monteceito. 
  <br><br>

Two or three years ago, my pre-dental organization group was supposed to meet together for our annual barbeque social at someone’s backyard on Del Playa Drive. Shockingly, their house was the one that sank with the eroded cliff. At first, everyone joked without realizing the significance of this event. The article stated that intensified erosion can cause 78% of the city’s bluff side to collapse. Not only am I worried about my current living situations and other UCSB kids that share this beautiful strip of beach in Isla Vista, I am also concerned with other populations that reside on the beach such as students that attend Santa Barbara Community College. 
  <br><br>

I am a quarter of California’s 40 million residents that live in high-risk fire zones. I am one of the tens of thousands of people that have packed up to evacuate. I hope one day I can tell others that I am not anymore.

Ventura County is also my home, and unfortunately, I too was one of the many residents that were put up for mandatory evacuation from the Thomas Fire. I was a Junior in high school at that time, and I still remember seeing the flames getting closer and closer to us as me and my family drove away from our house. Luckily our properties weren't damaged, thanks to the amazing job of the Ventura Firefighters, but it was the first time that I had a close encounter with a natural disaster of that degree. For me, it was an eye-opener, upon just how easy something that destructive can be brought to life by climate change. I too, also hope that one day I wouldn't live in such a high-risk fire zone.


<br><hr>
Ventura County is also my home and I have experienced many parts of the article. It is astonishing to believe that Ventura County has become a hub for wildfires. Some days in the summer in Ventura County, the temperatures in cities ten minutes away is ten degrees higher. Though I did not think of it much then, I know now that it is because of climate change. I can see drastic changes of temperature and weather in Santa Barbara. One day in Santa Barbara could be hot with slight ocean breeze and the next day it could be raining. Weather patterns are random and always changing. 
  <br><br>

I was surprised to hear about the results of climate change in our own backyard in Isla Vista. I had no idea that a house fell into the ocean on Del Playa because of the cliff eroding. I too am concerned for my living situations at school. This made me realize that climate change can affect anyone no matter where you live. We are all in danger.
  <br><br>

I liked how you touched on other parts of California that will likely be effective in the upcoming years due to the change in climate. We are sometimes selfish and forget to recall other living organisms other than humans that will suffer due to climate change. My family and I frequently travel to National Parks. In the future, I would like to revisit these same places the same way I saw them. Truth is, they may not exist within the next decade.
  <br><br>

People are not concerned enough about climate change. Though many of us, being in Santa Barbara, have experienced deadly wildfires, we are still not willing to make the change that is needed. Almost all (if not all) of my friends believe that climate change is a prominent issue and would like to help. However, the majority of them are not willing to change aspects of their daily lives such as going vegan because they believe that one person cannot make that big of a difference. This type of thinking is part of the problem on why significant change has not been done.
<br><hr>

Thank you for your response to my original comment. I’m glad your family and you are safe. Thomas Fire not only threatened the Ventura County but also caused major damage to nearby Monteceito. I am so thankful for the first responders during these wildfire outbursts. Just the other day, I read online that 23 firefighters had died in Australia while on duty. I’m honestly speechless at how the rate of the flames is dispersing in such a rapid manner. Thankfully, the rain did help relieve some heat, but I still think it’s extremely important to continue the effort of saving the animals that can’t escape on their own and also people that are trapped. If we don’t put in the effort to reduce the likelihood of these wildfires, then everywhere on the planet could end up being in a high-risk fire zone.
<br><hr>

I absolutely agree with you. Thinking that we will not make an impact because we are just a small group of individuals is what has caused us to have climate delay. People don't realize how much of a change they make by just changing their diet, saving water, electricity, etc...I know I am kind of a hypocrite too sometimes but I do try my best. Honestly, I think that the only reason people say that because they want to make an excuse to not change up their lifestyles, and probably because of that, more and more natural disasters will creep up on our front door.

Thanks for responding to my original comment. I agree it’s very difficult to view Ventura as the heart of wildfires since it’s literally on the water. My mom lives on the outskirt of Ventura County, closer towards the valley so when you ten degrees higher in the city, we probably felt twenty degrees or more. The hills over Camarillo trap the heat in. I think in Santa Barbara, you could feel the effects deepened by climate change on an even shorter scale. It doesn’t take days anymore because you can feel the increased intensity of any weathering event within a single day. It’s windier at night. The drastic temperature difference from day and night. 
  <br><br>

People who live by the oceans are especially prone to these erosion events. Unfortunately, it’s nature at work, but climate change is speeding up the process for sure. I’m a graduating senior and I will be moving away to a different state for four years, but I really hope when I return to my home state, things won’t be as bad as the rate they are following right now. I would love to go on hikes at my regular spots. I would love to sit on the beach and watch the sunset. I would love to go on walks in my neighborhood without worrying about my surrounding. I’m really disappointed with the current government on how they upkeep our National Parks. I remember a couple years ago, there wasn’t enough funding, so they had to shut down National Parks for weeks or longer. During that time, people were free to enter and exit without permits and they were also not fined for trashing the parks. I really hope things like that won’t happen again in the future because with climate change, these parks will not be able to withstand themselves. We need to deploy more human resources to these locations to help with maintenance. 
  <br><br>

I think going entirely vegan might be a little extreme. I promise myself to cut down my beef intake and I think I’ve been doing a pretty good job honestly. And I also have been trying to reduce food waste and I think that’s a great place to start for everyone.
<br><hr>

It breaks my heart every year when November comes around and it is wildfire season. I cannot believe this is the norm now in Ventura County. I agree, it astonishing that Ventura is center of all the wildfires when the ocean is only a couple minutes away. How many wildfires, how many homes destroyed, how many deaths will it take for people to realize that climate change is the biggest issue our planet faces?
  <br><br>

I also remember a couple years ago when National Park maintenance stopped. This was when our federal government shut down. National Park workers did not work because the federal government was not paying their employees during the shutdown. I don’t blame the workers for not working, I blame the government for not addressing this issue. These National Parks are some of the most sacred areas of nature that must be preserved. We need to be extra careful and make sure that our National Parks are well-looked-after because if they are destroyed, we may not have a second chance to restore them.

It is always most scare when we see things happen next to ourselves. When we watch a news talking about the fire in Australia, people do not really care because it is on the other side of the world. However, this time, it is happening in front of us, and the situation in front of us it is not good. Santa Barbara and Ventura are two of the place in the whole sates that are rising at the fastest rate. This thing is close relate to everyone. Everyone remembers the fire in last Thanksgiving break. The fire is in front of us, the numbers are showing the rising temperature and the sea levels are rising in front of IV. We have to admit this situations are true and the global warming is getting worse. 
  <br><br>


Due to the rising temperature, it is not just fires and sea level. It is about the whole ecosystems, just as the article mentioned, farmers now are switching their products due to the water limits, as professor mentioned in the video California is a big supply of the fruits and vegetables in the whole nation. It will affect the whole nation even the whole world in all different ways. It is never a small or single regional issue. The fire in Australia is not jus a fire in their country, the fire in Ventura is not just Ventura's issue. They are connected and united in the earth, it is a global issue that we need to be careful and pay attention.

A major issue that humanity needs to get past as we are confronted with the climate crisis is denial. This is critical because it is so much harder to make changes when people are going about their daily lives without actively reducing their carbon footprints.
  <br><br>

The article “2 degrees C: Beyond the Limit” opened my eyes to how rising sea levels are destroying our coasts as we know it. It hit close to home a bit more than others that we have read, although each of them does in fact affect us personally. I relate to the students who talk about how the buildings on Del Playa won’t be here in 20 years—especially with such shoddy construction of the buildings in IV. I often joke about how I live in a shack on a cliff.
  <br><br>

Reading about the effects of climate change in our very own county of Santa Barbara makes the crisis that we all face even more real. I think that something like this is just what people need in order to feel the proper sense of urgency that is long overdue.



</p><hr>


<p>

While  reading this article "2 degrees Celsius: Beyond the Limit" there were several different points that really caught my attention. One of them, was the comment made by Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams of " something important but remote",  Williams makes this comment in regards to the acknowledgment of climate change in Ventura county. I feel this is a belief that much of the United States holds, they may understand what climate change is and that it is happening but because it is not directly affecting them so they have no motivation to take action. Sadly, this is something horrible to live by because the effects of climate change may not be directly happening to many of us in this country right now but it will. We as a society should not wait till we are faced with certain doom to take action. The other fact is that we shouldn't be ignorant of the climate change impacts on other countries, for example the islands that are soon going to be flooded because of rising ocean levels which is going to cause forced mass migration for those inhabitants. 
  <br><br>

Another point in the article that caught my attention was that even when climate change is directly in our faces we are so reluctant to act. As mentioned in the article Santa Barbara and Ventura County are known for their environmental initiative and ideas but all those ideas are out out there but never enforced. There is no actual movement in the direction of stopping carbon emissions, or if there are plans being put out there big corporations such as the oil industry or businesses do all in their power to stop it. Everything appears to be centered around money and actually realizing the changes that must be done in order to save our future. In some ways people choose to adapt instead of deciding to address the direct cause of the change. For example, farmers choose to change their crops from high water needing agriculture to tropical and desert like plants so that they can endure the harsher climate. Although not mentioned, I wonder if these farmers are also changing their irrigation systems to conserve water, are they supporting environmentally friendly switches in politics and at their own homes. This of course not only applies to farmers but also to the general public and businesses, as how was mentioned that they are trying to get rid of parking in downtown Santa Barbra because car emissions is the number one cause of carbon emissions in the county but businesses push to not let is pass because it will affect their amount of profit. The focus on money is dangerous when regarding climate change, because it appears that we as a society and the big influencers won't act until is it directly impacting all of our lives.

I agree with what he said about how people are reluctant to take actions while they are directly facing the severe environmental problems that had been brought by climate change. As mentioned in the article, “Environmentalists are lobbying to put an end to it and to even replace parking lots on prime downtown real estate with housing. But that campaign has so far failed to budge the city council on an issue the business community says is key to profitability.” When I read through this, I was kind of astonished by the hostility and indifference of people facing the the environmental problems. What they really care is about the profitability at present instead of the survival crisis in the near future.

The idea that Santa Barbara is considered a birthplace for the modern environmental movement, yet the city failed to reduce their 2007 GHG emissions as promised serves as a huge wake up call for me. This failure to reduce, and instead increase GHG emissions made me realize that the mere words and promises of a government are not nearly enough to stop an issue like climate change. Although I do not necessarily think it is all on the government to fight climate change, I found it shocking that they would state something so bold and simply not adhere to it. This goes to show however that words and ideas are not enough to combat unsustainable behaviors, but it is instead reliant on actual action to make a real change.  

  <br><br>

Similarly, I found the comparison of the climate crisis to that of the refugee crisis very intriguing; simply because it is so true. Many of the so-called progressively minded individuals in Santa Barbara county are recognizing major global problems and even educate themselves about them. However, the problems often tend to not affect one's daily life in such a drastic way which makes it acceptable to continue practicing unsustainable behaviors in regards to the climate crisis. I am in no way excluding myself from this demographic however. I have learned about ways to live plant based, or cut out all single use plastics; yet, I still continue to eat a burger at DLG or use a plastic fork at Panda Express merely because it is convenient and the food continues to taste good. I don't believe people are necessarily wrong for doing these things because that is just the way that society has been developed. However, I do believe that education on these topics is important because it does make people think more about their actions, and every little action counts at this point. I'm not sure completely how to stop adding to our ecological footprint on this earth, but I do believe that each individual has the responsibility and capability to change their lifestyles in even minor ways to help our environment, as we are finally seeing the consequences of rising temperatures.

Almost every year during the summer my mom tells that it feels hotter than previous year, and all I would respond was "oh really thats weird" not giving any importance to the idea that the temperature really is increasing. I now realize that this was not just an opinion, but it is an actual very grave fact aside from many others that are being thrown at me throughout this article. Not only is this article educating me on more aspects of the climate crisis, but it is literally SLAPPING ME INTO A REALIZATION THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO THROUGH. 
  <br><br>
I am unsure which recent winter it was, it might have been more than once actually, but I remember watching the news and seeing homes, nature, and families being destroyed because of huge wildfire happening in Southern California. My weakness is animals, so as bad as this may sound, the moment I heard of and saw animals, specifically horses, dying and suffering because of these wildfires my heart literally broke. Now one may assume that because I was emotionally impacted for a few minutes by the situation I would have jumped into action to do something, anything whether big or small, to try and help with the situation, but no I honestly went on with my life afterwards. Somehow, after reading this article something just sparked. I have lived in Southern California my entire life, but even after watching many atrocious news casts and social media videos, or reading depressing viral tweets and a paragraph from apple news on another natural disaster in our area, I have never been more intrigued about the affects causing this dangerous rise in temperature along with the threatening effects that accompany it. 
  <br><br>
The actuality that the increasing temperature is just a nibble of this climate weirding is even more eye-opening and worrisome because there are literally so many more factors that are contributing to this destruction, and not enough contributing to counteract it. My eyes have literally been opened to not realizing but also understanding how the world around me, specifically the area I was born in and hope to spend the rest of my life in, is literally being demolished year by year, day by day.

I have the same feeling as you do. Before, the word “climate crisis” as well as its consequences look like unfamiliar with me. However, after reading the article and listening to the lecture, I realize that both of the severe wildfire in California before and the erosion cliffs in Isla Vista remind that the human-caused climate changes and the negative effects it brought are everywhere in my daily life. Nowadays, California is becoming hotter and drier due to the pollutions which humans made, and these are two crucial factors for a catastrophic fire. Although in a conference held in 2015, Santa Barbara set up the goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emission down by fifteen percent than 2007, it eventually turned out that it produced the amount of pollutions which exceed 2007 by fourteen percent. 
  <br><br>
The reasons for this happening can be basically divided into two parts. First, people didn’t pay lots of attention to the climate crisis. As the lecture mentioning, most of people in Santa Barbara related the negative effects of the climate crisis to the rising of sea-level a decade ago. People didn’t have enough understanding of climate change. People’s selfish desires also play significant roles in negative climate changes. In Santa Barbara, the greenhouse gases, as well as the fuels from the cars, can be considered as a huge factor that affects the climate, yet people are not going to reduce their utilization of the cars.
<br><br>
Both the reading and the lecture provide some severe consequences of the climate crisis. People should come up with some methods to stop, or at least control, the climate changes before these consequences become reality.

The article, “2ºC: Beyond the limit” by Scott Wilson, at the beginning immediately brings attention to the fact that over a short amount of time, weather patterns in Santa Barbara County started to shift drastically. It started it off in 2016 with huge fires, in 2017 with heavy rain, and began to become a year round occurrence. A fact that caught my eye, which could or could not be true, is that the coastal curve that bends south of Santa Barbara is said to be warming at double the rate than the entire continental United States. Which led me to my first question: Why? It is said in the article that it’s still unknown as to why this is, besides the fact the we emit a lot of pollution into the atmosphere just like any other city. What makes us different from the rest? Some things that aren’t unknown to us is the fact that our climate is rapidly changing and for the worst. It seems that every year it just keeps getting worse and worse. There are even incidents where lives are lost from these “natural” catastrophes. One thing that I find ironic is that it’s said that Santa Barbara is known for being the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, yet we’re said to be “environmental poseurs”, because we only talk the talk, but we don’t walk the walk… or at least as much as we say we do. We say that we are going to be reducing our emissions when in fact the opposite happens and they continue to rise.  If we are what sparked the modern environmental movement and we cannot take actions into our own hands about the environment, then who will?

I completely agree with the fact that it is ironic that Santa Barbara has failed to take action in spite of all their advocacy for environmental regulation. The one thing that I hear consistently from the political right is that people on the political left are hypocritical. Santa Barbara's failure to take action and set an example in the wake of their environmental movement perpetuates that unfortunate stereotype. On top of that, because Santa Barbara is the birth place of the modern environmental movement, like you said, if we don't take action, no one will. 
<br><br>
Growing up California, many of us have seen natural disasters from earthquakes to small tsunamis. However for me personally, nothing has made me more aware of climate change than seeing the smoke from the wildfires down in Orange County choke every man, woman, and child visiting Disneyland a few years ago. The sky was orange, the sun was obscured. Disneyland is sort of seen as this bubble, this safe haven where children can be carefree and spend a day with their families. That day, however, the outside world permeated that little bubble and made it a very dark place. Climate change on a bigger scale will do this to our communities where some of us live in denial of the impending consequences. 
<br><br>
As a California and Santa Barbara resident, reading about how the agriculture of California is being impacted and about the dependency that most of the country has on our produce was shocking. Considering how California is one of the largest producers of almonds and avocados, I don't see how those crops will survive in a changing environment where climate weirding makes the growing conditions unpredictable. While it is proactive for farmers to diversify their crops, it is sad that this is necessary.

My hometown from my birth till I set off to college was the Bay Area. As I came to UCSB for my first quarter in college, I was astonished by how warm and nice weather was here in Santa Barbara. I would say to my friends “Wow! I can’t believe it’s almost winter and it is still over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, we are so fortunate!” I realized how wrong I was after reading the article 2°C: Beyond the Limit and watching Professor Hiltner’s video on the impacts of the climate crisis right here in Santa Barbara. I have now learned the horrifying truth that the nice “warm” weather that I enjoyed so much throughout the fall and winter seasons here in Santa Barbara was because “since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit.” I also suddenly realized that just last quarter there was a wildfire north of campus and the fire could be seen from FT. The realization of how close the climate crisis is to me and how I was so blind to its effects is both scary and frustrating. I am frustrated at myself for being naive and unable to see the climate crisis or bring about a mindset to care about the climate crisis when examples of the crisis is literally right in front of me. The article highlighted how erosion due to rising sea levels is impacting houses on Del Playa. I also saw the effects on erosion while enjoying the beaches right next to campus without giving a second thought to why the erosion was occurring. 

<br><br>

 Reading about the Thomas Fire was very interesting and insightful because I can relate to what it is like to be impacted by a nearby wildfire. When I lived in NorCal I also experienced frequent wildfires that would pollute the air and destroy the livelihood of hundreds of people who lived nearby the fires. When the fire in Santa Barbara began, I heard about it on the local news and saw it as a “regular” occurrence. It is incredibly saddening to realize that wildfires are now just another yearly event that we can expect as the “norm.” The devastating effects of the Thomas Fire taught me that the climate crisis is impacting everyone and everywhere. This further strengthens my belief that everyone needs to act now because the climate crisis is not going to spare any of its victims. We are all going to be affected by it because there is nowhere to run or hide.

<br><br>

 I agree with Professor Hiltner when he states that wildfires, rising sea levels, and tornadoes may not be our only problems when it comes to the climate crisis. Effects that we can’t predict such as shortages of food, human displacement and conflicts, and wars for natural resources are all events that we cannot predict and events that we can prevent if we all take the climate crisis seriously. The article highlights how ironic the Santa Barbara County is when it comes to taking care of the environment and rejecting policies that support the pollution of the Earth. Santa Barbara oiling and the demand for more parking spaces are the major demands that prevent more environment-friendly policies and laws to be enacted in the county. The article also highlights how there is no one to enforce the plants to move forward in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Personally, I believe that our generation needs to act fast and take control of politics within our counties to make drastic changes to the policies contributing to the climate crisis.

I find it truly unfortunate and disappointing that it seems like human beings have lost their ability to compromise. Our political system has also seen a major shift towards politicians doing everything not for the good of the people that elected them, but rather to get re-elected and maintain relationships with businesses that sponsor their campaigns.

<br><br>

The United States was founded on compromise, ranging from the Great Compromise to establish the legislative branch to the electoral college compromise. However, lately it seems as if we have gone too far off of the compromising path to turn back now. People are too far rooted in their ideas of the success of business and money to see the real issues going on. Yes, these businesses provide jobs and boost the economy, but what are jobs to people who don't have houses because they are taken down by rising sea levels and fires?

<br><br>

I was disappointed to read that the Santa Barbara County Climate Action Plan does not have any mandatory rules for businesses to follow. As Tomás Morales Rebecchi put it, "there are no teeth to these plans". What is the point of having rules if there is nothing to check the people who the rules are made for? The answer is, optics. Politicians can say that they have done something for the environmental cause, thus maintaining the vote of the people and getting re-elected, and they can still maintain their relationship with businesses. The general public needs to realize that these climate agreements have no strings attached and that they are being lied to.

People such as President Trump doesn’t believe the global warming. He talked about this opinion in a speech years ago. I believe that the temperature is rising, but I found out that a lot of people tend to think that the climaye change in the area where they live is the climate change on Earth.
<br><br>
I, of course, am an undergrad at UCSB. California has a very similar climate as my hometown, Shenzhen, in southern China, according to others. My dad came from northern China, so according to Chinese custom, I come from northern China. I have been to Santa Barbara for more than one year (I am sophomore now). To tell you the truth, Santa Barbara is extremely cold and windy and rainy from fall to July. I don’t know whether it is cold in August or not because I haven’t take Summer Session B yet but I will definitely take Summer Session B in 2020. In October 2019, the second week of Fall quarter 2018, heavy rain started and I fell from my bike on my way to class and got injured. Although it’s extremely sunny in the day time in June to July, it’s very cold in the morning and in the evening. How can the extremely cold weather let people believe that the global temperature is rising? (I believe that the global temperature is rising. Other people may not be afraid of cold.)
<br><br>
California is said to be as the same temperature as southern China (are you sure? These two places are big, so clearly you are making this stuff up…) One typical example in southern China is my city Shenzhen. I do worried about the extremely hot and sunny summer every year, but is that representing that the temperature is rising globally? Clearly not. I don’t think that 20 years ago (I am 20 ) the summer in Shenzhen was not as hot as it is today.
<br><br>
I don’t even need to talk about northern China now. Just think whether you want to consider partial climate as global climate.

2°C: Beyond the limit, written by Scott Wilson, illustrates a large number of environmental issues. By describing the impact of fire, flood and other natural disasters, the author highlights the negative influence of climate change on humans, which improves the awareness of humans toward catastrophe. Besides, lots of real examples create an atmosphere of sadness, conveying painful emotions. At the end of the article, an unsolved example is used to deepen people’s worry about environmental degradation and leave readers with space to think.

<br><br>

“Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote.” I believe that is everyone’s thought before entering colleges (At least for me). I thought I was living in a peaceful place. People are happy here and all the worries are coming from earning money or teaching their children. I can’t believe those disasters were so close to us. This passage really made me realize the reality and as a student at UCSB, I really hope that this beautiful city, Santa Barbara, can reduce the emission of wasted gas under our efforts.

I agree with you on this article that the author details how the weather in California is getting worse. The mountain fire at the end of last year has once again sounded the alarm for us. Many floods, fires in California, more and more extreme weather days, and far more than expected carbon dioxide emissions have proved that the weather in California, even Santa Barbara goes from bad to worse. Environmental issues and economic issues have always been a dilemma. Many potential economic sources like oil resources have hidden environmental problems. When California is rich enough, should we re-examine the trade-off between economy and environment?
<br><br>
Also, I don't quite agree with what you said that disaster was far from us before we came to UCSB. We can always see fires, earthquakes, and even tsunami in news reports. The 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China, and the tsunami and nuclear radiation crisis in Japan a few years ago, and this mountain fire in California are telling us that if we do not pay attention to the environmental crisis, disasters will happen, and they will become more and more serious and frequently. Therefore, we must do our utmost to protect the environment.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that we need to reduce emission of greenhouse gases in this beautiful city. And it's sad what seem so remote now has become " an annual event [forest fire]." Moreover, the article uses numerous charts, graphs to illustrate how temperature here in Ventura County has risen over the average temperature rises in the U.S. What's even more sad is that the county's goal was to reduced greenhouse gases 15% compare to 2007 levels, instead it has increased to 14%. What this means is that we need laws and policies that aim to reduce carbon emission, like the carbon tax in Santa Barbara County. We need people who can enforce, follow up with plans like the article discusses " No Teeth in plans," it doesn't do anything until people commit and carry out their actions.





</span></div><hr>


<p>

I find it is crazy to think that the temperature in nearby Ventura has already risen 2.6 degrees Celsius. That is well above what the limit that the Paris Accords is trying to prevent. The sad part is that in Santa Barbara, the temperature has risen 2.3 degrees Celsius, and we are one of the leading green counties. This is alarming to me, because if our politics in Santa Barbara are saying they are for saving the environment when we refuse to cut down on parking  to reduce the number of cars and refuse to stop oil companies off the shore. We need to add more bite to our bark. We are also very much feeling the effects on our crops with many of them dying, causing farmers to change their ways in such a short amount. This is changing livelihoods of many Californians, because if our crops fail, they will be more expensive, if it gets too hot, our health will then also be put at risk. I mean with the cliffs falling into the ocean due to erosion caused by us, UCSB will need to change tradition and party on a different street.
<br><br>



With that being said, I still believe that Santa Barbara can be an example of a green county that we want it to be. If we actually enforced our policies that preserve our environment, we will be the gold example and drastically cut our carbon down and stop fracking off our shores. This will be crucial in the coming future because no one has really done anything to drastically fight climate change in any county in our nation. If we can show how to successfully be green, this will cause other counties to follow. It is important that we set the example because if we don’t with are policies that are already set in place, who will. Again there is a lot to be done for our country to try to reverse the climate crisis, but I believe if we can make some sort of change anywhere in our country, we have hope in saving our earth.

I think the fact that we are seeing such such adverse and intense effects could be a "good" thing - especially because it is generally thought that our situation is at least partially reversible. 
<br><br>

These catastrophes are very animated and irrefutable proofs of climate change, and will be a wake up call for many people - who as the article says, thought this problem was important but far away. The damage caused by these natural hazards could also be  "good" thing in the big picture because it could actually provide a tangible economic incentive for the so-called carbon tax. Since climate change will keep wreaking havoc on the economy, at some point it will be in the interest of government and even in some cases big corporations to look at carbon tax as a viable and even necessary solution to offset the damage and keep the economy flowing amidst the chaos.
<br><br>

This, compounded by the adversely affected, and in many cases affluent - as in Montecito, people that will increasingly start mobilizing and lobbying against fossil fuel and non-sustainable interests may turn out to be a great ally for the battle of the climate crisis. So all in all, it is a good thing that we are feeling and living these adverse, climate-change-induced effects (unfortunately).

I think you have a very interesting perspective, and I would have to say I agree with this. In order for change to come about, EVERYONE needs to believe in the climate crisis, especially the more affluent, politicians, and fossil fuel company owners. It is unfortunate, but I agree that we must experience a certain degree of damage and destruction to finally wake up and see that something has to change.
<br><br>

I am from New Jersey, and have never experienced wild fires in my area. However, I have lived through the infamous "Snowtober", a massive blizzard that came in the middle of October, seemingly out of nowhere. Trees fell, streets iced over, and my entire town was out of power for nearly a week. Only a year later we experienced Hurricane Sandy. Luckily, I do not live near the coast of New Jersey, which was definitely hit the hardest, but I experienced destruction and chaos similar to "Snowtober". Both events seemed to have come out of nowhere, and even though I was only in middle school, I knew neither event was a "normal" occurrence for my area of the country.
<br><br>

As I have gotten older and become more educated on the climate crisis, lived through random days of 80 degree weather in January (very unusual for NJ winters), and experienced extremely severe snow and thunderstorms seemingly out of nowhere, I question how anyone living in my area could deny climate change. We all lived through it, and none of these events can be written off as coincidences. Sadly, I do think people in power are aware of the crisis. I believe they choose to deny it to protect their own interests in the profitable fossil fuel industry, and could not care less about how current Americans and future generations will be affected since their money will always keep them safe.

<br><hr>
Although having the adverse effects of climate change are in no way positive or helpful for anyone, I agree with your perspective. Now that the effects of climate change are becoming real and more of a reality for wealthy people who believed that climate change would not effect them, more people are beginning to accept our fate. Just as you said, I also agree that eventually the government will begin to feel the repurcussions of climate change, just as we all have, and will make changes. I agree that this is a wake up call for many people...even though it is dissapointing that it took THIS much for people to accept that climate change is indeed our reality. Being from Southern California, I have personally experienced many evacuations due from fire danger and have seen homes of people I knew being burned down. This is real, and unfortunately until it happens to someone in their own backyard, they will not realize it. This should not be a political battle. This is a constant reality that will effect all of us no matter who we are!

Thanks for your response, yes exactly, the best argument to make is not only is the climate changing, which climate deniers can argue is  a natural occurrence, but that it is changing at an unprecedented rate, never seen before. I am an international student from the island of Cyprus and there we have seen another side of the issue. Cyprus historically suffers from seasonal droughts, every 3-4 years we ran out of water and derive most of it  from desalination or via tankers from other countries, we where on a path to become a desert-like terrain. Then, in the last 5 years we have broken rainfall records. Our rivers/dams are all full for years in a row - something that had never happened for 30 years even once. In the summer, nearly everyday we where getting clouds and tropical showers for 40 mins in the afternoon - something unprecedented for us. Sattelite imagery shows that Cyprus' and the surrounding area's geology has changed dramatically. For the most part it seems like climate change is benefitting Cyprus, something that was predicted by some experts some time ago. Point is - this is a very unpredictable phenomenon, we are playing with fire.

Thanks for your response, I defer you to my other reply if you want to hear how it has affected my home country :)

I find your ideas on economic and environmental damage forcing people to pay more attention to the climate interesting, but I can't help but to feel that it may take too long for the right people to take action. First, there have already been a multitude of accounts of climate catastrophes, such as the paradise fires and the current Australia fires, yet there hasn't been enough action taken to show for what our climate has been through. Many feel sad and donate money for the homes, lives, and ecosystems lost, but often don't take steps to deal with the core issue which is global climate change. In addition, many of the higher-up officials and people of power don't feel the same economic impacts that the farmers of Santa-Barbara deal with. After all, the climate crisis doesn't affect everyone equally, and its the poor that are effected most. That being said, we need people with the power to influence environmental policies to take notice of the climate crisis. This will happen eventually, but it may be too late.

The article begins with the story of Terri Bowman, a camping resort manager in the Santa Barbara area. The Sherpa Fire, then the mud wall form the El Capitan Canyon, and finally the Real fires. Yet, when the Real Fires arrived in late October of 2018, Terri and her crew were ready. She said that they had just “shifted into action” because they were so “used to it.” After relatively little to no activity in the Santa Barbara area pre-2016, the past years - and the heatening climate that comes along with it - have affected people like Terri, who had to spend $250,000 in repairs for her resort. But, according to Terri, this is to be expected. The once-a-year climate disaster that hits the Santa Barbara County area. 

<br><br>

Terri’s story is not unique. Yes, it may be tragic, but stories can be found all throughout Santa Barbara county. Yet, I do not think that the quantity of stories are the cost of damages is the emphasizing point within this article. What remains to be said: this is now the new normal; it is expected. Instead of trying to combat climate change; instead of identifying the solutions to the problem, we seek the remedies for our own peace of mind. It is not the problem that mere premise of climate change is being rejected. On the contrary, the legislators of Santa Barbara have repeatedly said that they would help to push back against local businesses’ and oil refineries’ to prevent further environmental restrictions that help combat this global crisis. Yet, the words of the city of Santa Barbara remain irrelevant; nothing but broken promises and empty words. After announcing that they wanted to reduce carbon emissions 15 percent in comparison to the 2007 amounts, the city of Santa Barbara released 14 percent more emissions in 2015 - the year that emissions were supposed to be down. 

<br><br>

The city of Santa Barbara can be progressive and push for environmentally policies all they want, but the reality of the situation is that those policies do not reflect the actions that they are supposed to initiate. So, why do we continue to look at the problems, say we are going to fix it, and then leave it alone, or worse, proceed to create a more dire situation? Well, I guess the simple explanation is that it is just easier to watch the world burn - literally and figuratively. At this point, the climate crisis - although solvable - seems to be “out of our hands” to many. This goes back to Terri and her camping resort. We prepare for an event that can damage our livelihoods; it is no surprise, but rather, expected. This new norm makes us believe that this is our new reality, and instead of fighting this new-founded “normal”, we accept it, because it is the easier choice. In all honesty, who can blame them? Change is difficult to force. And not only one person, but the collective must endure reaching the results that our planet needs. But, our society, our community, our species needs to help change this norm; we need to look to stand with one another and fight instead of becoming bystanders on the sidelines.

This week's reading was very interesting since it had to do with Santa Barbara and I like it when I could directly relate to something and now that I live in Santa Barbara it is interesting to find out more about a city where I was raised growing up.  However, what was revealed about the city was tragic.  In the reading, past events were explained and one was the Sherpa Fire.  The Sherpa Fire was in June 2016 and was very destructive with the damaged it caused.  In Santa Barbara due to climate change every year since 2016, there is an annual fire and in 2017 just one year later the largest fire in state history  happened, Thomas Fire, and burned more than 281,000 acres.  Also, a severe storm had hit around the same time that also caused an evacuation order.  The storm caused 23 people to be killed and some houses to be put into the sea.  
 <br><br>

I knew in the past year that fires started around December in Santa Barbara and I thought that had always been the usual.  However, after the article I know that was not always the case the fires only started to happen annually after 2016.  
 <br><br>

I also found that the increase in temperature by 2 degrees had a major consequence surprising.  I thought the temperature would have to go up a lot more in order to cause problems.  Finding out that John Kleinwachter, a La Paloma Ranch manager, had to pretty much stop farming avocadoes and start to adapt to the climate.  He now farms tropical crops that could survive a warmer climate and stopped with very water-intensive crops.  I thought this was bad because I never thought of food going extinct in a way before.  I know avocadoes are not going "extinct" because other places will be able to farm them, however, with the climate warming what is stopping other farmers from farming crops that could handle the warmer climate.  Later on, every farmer will just stop trying to care for crops that are too sensitive to the adaptation the world puts upon them.  
 <br><br>

I also did not know that Ventura was the fastest-warming county in all of the lower 48 states.  Living in Santa Barbara right by Ventura is scary because we will get some of the effects from Ventura getting warmer.  We can already see those effects by the data that was reported in 2017 that Santa Barbara has exceeded emissions by 14 percent according to 2007 levels.  The county wanted to reduce emissions by 15 percent but failed and increased by 14 percent.

Now more than ever, wildfires have become an increasing trend in Central California due to climate change. In fact, according to the Post, " The average temperature in Santa Barbara county has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celcius." As I am writing this comment, I am learning more and more about the environmental changes occurring day to day in Santa Barbara county. I live in the Sabado Tarde street apartments, one block away from Del Playa where the beach is. Erosion has claimed a major part of the houses near the beach cliff. Last week I went surfing, I did not notice the houses near Del Playa were reinforced with netting and concrete columns.  This is unreal! Not once have I came across any type of regard or email from the school telling us how much Isla Vista conditions changed due to the climate crisis.  

 <br><br>

Wildfires in California have been a thing for as long as I remember. However, get this, according to the article " 10 million Californian residents now live in high-risk fire zones. Let's go back to week 9 of the Fall quarter, the UCSB community was warned and evacuated by a wildfire. A year before that, there was yet another wildfire. Fortunately, I have not been a victim of a wildfire. In spite of this, I still have the moral obligation to do something about it. I promise to donate 100$ to the California Wildfire Relief Fund. The roots of natural disasters and environmental changes in Central California go back to the invisible force aka Climate change.  We can decide to save the world. Let us forgot about our past and work on the present to secure the best future.

I found this article to be incredibly enlightening considering I grew up in Salt Lake City Utah and know little about Santa Barbara and Ventura County- and to say the least it was interesting to see the effects climate change is having on our very own community. I found it interesting that this place, a city self dedicated to environmentalism, is still so far from following through with their intentions when it comes to being environmentally conscious. I remember one of the things I noticed while first touring ucsb was how environmentally centered everything seemed, and I will say I was beyond happy to see this, however I was sad to hear that residents aren't meeting the goals. There is a fantastic public transit system here, and I feel as though individuals should take advantage of it more often so that we as a city can cut emissions and be leading force in this road to rehabilitating our planet. I was shocked to hear that farmers have been forced to plant things such as coffee, mainly because I thought things like that were grown in harsher tropical climates. This really showed me how drastically the changes to this area are... thats, insane.
 <br><br>

Thinking back on things and my childhood in Salt Lake I realize that my own hometown has too seen the effects of this plight. I remember as a young kid winters in Utah were always so beautiful. There were several feet of snow for months! Utah's claim to fame is literally "the best snow on earth" and all the ski resorts in town saw great success because we did in fact have the best snow... but the same can't be said now. As I got older it seemed the snow started to fade, winters became more erratic, and the inversion that settles over the valley got so bad some days kids aren't even allowed outside for recess. There was even a tornado once, which is incredibly crazy considering salt lake city is a small valley surrounded by mountains. It makes me sad. The two christmases before my family moved to LA were incredible warm, no snow in the valley. My friends that work at the ski resorts have told me that resorts have had to shift their seasons because the snowfall is so different. To put it honestly, salt lake is depressing in the winter when there is no snow- and it is heart breaking to know that kids there don't get to experience all the fun memories I had growing up. My elementary school was situated as the point of the mountain and there was a large hill we would always sled down during recess, and it is still one of my fondest memories. As the climate continues to change, cities globally will be hurt, just like Santa Barbara has been and just like my hometown has been.

Prior to reading this article, I had only a little background on why the Santa Barbara area is so prone to wildfires and drastic weather changes. I knew that the Santa Ana winds brought dry air from the mountains towards the beaches in the Ventura and Santa Barbara areas, which explains the Thomas Fire. However, I did not know Santa Barbara was especially in danger from other factors, like the effects of the 1969 oil spill and a significant rise in sea level, causing the cliffs along Del Playa to decay. The level of seriousness of the issue hit me as I was halfway through the article; if an acclaimed national newspaper decided to cover the issues of our own backyard, we should feel even more eager to fight against climate change. Not that there are already many organizations on our campus as well as throughout Santa Barbara, the lives lost and tragedies that have occurred prove that we must be more proactive in how we treat our home. If we continue at this rate, Isla Vista will never be the same. It will be even more dangerous to live in the area, especially near the mountains, because fires and mudslides will continue to occur throughout the decades in smaller intervals. 

 <br><br>

I think this article was extremely beneficial to see the climate crisis on a smaller level. Ken states that we must be able to look at climate change in a global sense, but seeing it happen in our community can have a bigger impact on people's opinions and the actions they decide to take. Another important aspect that he covers is the affect on agriculture in California. He says that California alone produces a little under 50% of the country's fruit, vegetable, and nut supply. With the climate change in Southern California, the plants are dying from the drastic temperature changes throughout the day, otherwise known as "global weirding." When continuing life at this rate, America and other nations' food supplies will be affected. Ultimately, the universe is giving us every possible sign that the way we live must change in order to save our homes.

Anxious, terrified, and worried are certainly feelings I have after knowing that climate crisis has been happening around where I live. However, besides those feelings, what should we do? I reflect on the various human activities that have contributed to the climate crisis we are experiencing now, and wondering what attitudes and behaviors should we have to face the uncertain future. 
 <br><br>

I actually stayed over the Christmas break this winter and received the same alert notifications as Ken did, and I was shocked then but also hardly believed it's true. Now, as revealed by Ken and the article from The Washington Post, I see the story underlying that danger that could potentially threaten our lives. As the video explains, climate changes are happening everywhere around the world. I grew up in Beijing and experienced the "smog disaster" that happened about 5 years ago, and I was our school's smog monitoring volunteer back then, so I vividly and scientifically experienced the Climate Crisis happened to my motherland. Thankfully, as I grew up from a middle schooler to a college student, the sky of Beijing has becoming clearer and bluer and now it is just like the beautiful and "normal" sky before the that "smog disaster". With that change witnessed by my own eyes, I think I am relatively optimistic on the issue of Climate Crisis in a global context. I understand that there are a lot of scientific explanations for different climate phenomena and a lot of political complexities behind environmental regulations and policies, but if the government can attach great importance to the issue, and people can feel the costs of climate change immediately by themselves, and media and education can add more environmental consciousness to the general public, the impossibilities may become possible, just like Piers Sellers said.

In the article “2°C: Beyond the limit”, the author mainly focusses on global warming that cause fire, flood and free parking in California. From 1895, the average temperature of Santa Barbara has increased 2.3 degree Celsius, and nearby city Ventura has increased 2.6 degree Celsius, the government want to control the temperature do not rise and exceed 2 degree Celsius. 2 degree Celsius is a normal digital number that before I do not feel, just like it is a bit hot, I do not even feel the nuances. However, after reading this article, I began to know serious consequence that only 2 degree Celsius brings. I was shocked as well. I have the same experience with Yuli Xue as well. I come from China as well. I saw the sky of my hometown get greyer, and people go outside needs to wear masks in winter. It is so sad to see these environment change because of climate change.

Fires have become a part of life in California in recent years. Most of us who live here have suffered from them. Evacuations, houses burnt down, and lives being ruined happen to many people here yearly. I have family who are at risk of being caught in these fires. It's a scary thought knowing that you might lose everything to these fires - imagine the house you grew up in going up in flames.  
<br><br>

I am happy that some farmers in California are growing more drought-resistant crops. Instead of waiting around for miracles to happen, we should prepare for the worst. We have to start conserving water. As rainfall becomes more scarce and the state becomes drier, it is better to start preparing now. 
<br><br>

I am not surprised that Santa Barbara has not made progress in fighting climate change. It's difficult to fight climate change when you have to change your lifestyle for it - but maybe there are less extreme ways of combating climate change like using more solar panels. I feel like removing parking lots isn't the best decision because it will prevent people from visiting and shopping in Santa Barbara. Regardless, we have to make decisions on climate change before it's too late.

Coming from a town an hour from Santa Barbara, I can confirm that experiencing a fire is a Californian right of passage. It is terrifying to know that, like you said, our childhood houses might end up in flames due to this climate crisis. As for farmers, I am glad that they are prepared for the worst, but it is sad that THEY have to change their whole way of living (growing different fruits, new systems, etc.), but the people who were elected and should be making changes are not. I agree that removing parking lots is not the best move right now, I think there could be better things to do, but I am not sure what. The article mentions implementing solar panels, but the people would need to pay for it, which I know my dad would not. As Ken says we need to elect people into office that will actually do something and not be bought by corporations.

I totally understand what you’ve said and the reason why you are feeling that way . It is true and it is the fact that fire has been happening every year in California in different parts of it. It is extremely horrible and sad to see how much the fire could impact people’s lives and property,and the environment that causing so much smoke and air pollution. When I was in Santa Barbara during the fires had happened, I personally experienced how bad the smoke was for our health and watching all the news about it in how people have to be evacuated from their houses or even lost their houses were really bad. But I do think this is what the environment is trying to remind us: that we are having climate crisis and our environment is changing due to global warming.
<br><br>
I do think it is a good thing that people adapted to it by growing more drought-resistant crop and knw about to reserve water, but it is only something we can adapted to to deal with the problem we are facing now. If no other real actions to be taken to really address the climate change problem, the weather can get even worse and until that time, it might not be something we can easily deal with. And it is not just Santa Barbara, many places or cities or countries have actually been trying to or have said will address the issue and implement some policies to deal with it, but not many of them are doing enough and we actually don’t se  a huge change on our climate. It is something hard to deal with but it is something we shouldn’t stop working on until we can be sure that we are making sufficient change and to keep the earth a sustainable one.

I've lived in Southern California for my entire life. As a kid, I was terrified of the tornadoes I heard about on the news and the tornadoes I saw in movies such as The Wizard of Oz. However, my mother would always comfort me by telling me how tornadoes would never come close to us; they'd stay in the plains and occasionally occur in Northern California. Therefore, I let go of my fear of tornadoes, which I felt I would only ever see in videos and pictures, and focused on actual threats to my home such as earthquakes. Now that I live in Santa Barbara and now that I've realized that these kinds of storms might get stronger over the next couple of years, my fear is back.
<br><br>

In Scott Wilson's article in the Washington Post, he states that since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara has warmed 2.3 degrees Celsius. It doesn't sound like much in Celsius, but when converted into Fahrenheit, it's 36.14 degrees! This shocked me. So, I did my own research. 
<br><br>

According to US Climate Data, in January 2010 the average temperature in Santa Barbara was 57.35 degrees Fahrenheit. 10 years later, in 2019 the average temperature in Santa Barbara was 55.35 degrees Fahrenheit. Many people might see these numbers and try to use them to disprove global warming, as the average temperature seems to be getting lower. However, January is in the winter and according to National Geographic, you can expect harsher summers AND winters in a warming world. That means that in winter, temperatures will be lower! 
<br><br>

According to NASA, with an increase in greenhouse gases, the atmosphere has a higher pressure, making cold air in the Arctic move south to balance out pressure. This causes colder winters in the US. This process is called Arctic Oscillation. This process can lead to a type of positive feedback loop. With harsher and colder winters, people will use more energy to heat their houses, a lot of that energy coming from fossil fuels. The more fossil fuels extracted, the more greenhouse gases in the air, and the stronger climate change. 
<br><br>

If you look at summer in Santa Barbara, according to US Climate Data, the average temperature in August 2010 was 66.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 9 years later in SB, the average temperature was 68.3 degrees Fahrenheit. There was a small increase in the average temperature. However, as you proceed into the months of September and October, that increase gets greater. The average temperature in September 2010 was 64 degrees Fahrenheit, while the average temperature in September 2019 was 68.55 degrees Fahrenheit! Finally, the average temperature in October 2010 was 62.1 degrees Fahrenheit and the average temperature in October 2019 was 66.35 degrees Fahrenheit.
<br><br>

The months of September and October are important. They are the months leading up to winter. They are the months in which the temperatures cool down from the high temperatures of July and August. In 2010, the average decrease in temperature between August and September in SB was about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile, in 2019, the average decrease in temperature between August and September in SB was about .2 degrees Fahrenheit! This slower decrease can be attributed to greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases allow the atmosphere to trap in heat, and it takes a couple weeks or longer for this heat to be released. The more heat there is, particularly in the summer, and the more greenhouse gases there are, the more time it must take for this heat to be released and the more it time it must take for the temperature to cool down. 
<br><br>

The climate crisis has allowed for a climate that is perfect for more severe storms such as wildfires and to my misfortune, tornadoes.

As someone who has lived in the Central Valley of California, Northern California and even Pennsylvania, I have experienced first-hand tornados, earthquakes, and fires. It was always something that was on the more rare side of the things that would happen, however, I keep seeing more and more that it's becoming the norm in these areas. Moving to UCSB was the first time that I had ever lived by the ocean and it was a lot to take in. The new dangers of ocean levels rising was just the tip of the iceberg. My small towns never discussed climate change. A fire was just a fire. The more frequent they became, the less we had answers. This course is giving me those answers, exposing me to the dangers of the rising temperatures and rising ocean levels. The author claims that Santa Barbara is more interested in how they look than how they live really concerns me because I thought Santa Barbara was making great strides in combatting the climate crisis. If this town is what a problem looks then I am afraid of what this problem will escalate to in the coming years. 
<br><br>
The article outlines the Thomas fire, which I had no idea about at all, and I also had no idea that over break there was even a threat of a tornado in Santa Barbara at all. The cliffs on DP I knew were a problem, but again, I had no idea that we may not even have housing there in a couple of decades. The thought of everything changing as I know it to be now is terrifying and we need to take action, even if it does cost some money.

After reading this article, this quote stood out to me the most: “The county conducts a full inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions only once every three years. And its Climate Action Plan imposes no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals.” I believe this quote reveals many of the flaws seen in our local and national governments regarding our climate. The idea that Santa Barbara county is only monitoring its greenhouse gas emissions once a year reveals that the policy makers for this plan are not up to date on our current climate crisis. If they were aware of the vast changes Santa Barbara county is facing on a yearly basis, I believe they would have the desire to fully inventory the emissions much more often. The second part of this quote  was even more shocking to me. With no mandatory regulations on businesses or individuals, average citizens are not going to limit their emissions if it is essentially seen as “limitless” under the Climate Action Plan. Our lifestyles have accustomed us to act selfishly if given the opportunity. We are always going to use as many resources as we need if there are no regulations or punishments for using too much.  
<br><br>

I believe this quote most likely can be found to be representative of many counties across our country. If we want to mitigate the extreme crisis we have caused, we need to implement laws and regulations that limit our emissions as individuals and businesses. I believe one of the most effective ways to do so is to provide an incentive for businesses who emit less. Another strategy would be to set a cap on emissions with a penalty if it is surpassed. The only problem with this strategy, in my opinion, is that large corporations will simply pay the penalty and continue to emit more than they are supposed to. The fee associated with emitting too much would not burden mega corporations. By providing a stipend, capitalistic businesses will be able to increase their profits and emit less.

I completely agree with you. I, too, was shocked by the fact that there are no real consequences for emitting too much CO2 into the atmosphere within Santa Barbara County. While it's wonderful that there is a committee dedicated to monitoring and reporting on the climate crisis, that is not enough. They need to go beyond collecting data and create true laws and limits for people in the county. Only then, can we guarantee that some positive change will occur. This is especially important because Santa Barbara and Ventura County's temperatures are rising at a rate seemingly double the national average. If we want to promote national and international change, we need to start locally. The article mentioned that we have some of the most environmentally minded government employees in the state and this should make it easy to convince our representatives of the need to create legal consequences for emitting too much pollution into the air. 
<br><br>
Fires, droughts and mudslides have ruined farms and other businesses so close to us. Since these events have not personally happened to every single inhabitant of the county, it may be hard to see climate change as a current issue. You are right when you say that people tend to be selfish if they see no negative consequence. While I'm sure the Climate Action Plan is doing great work, it is crucial that they extend their role and work to promote laws that can curb our exorbitant consumption of something so damaging.  If not, the  rate of fires and mudslides will only increase and will damage people's homes, livelihoods, etc.
<br><hr>

I agree with you that it is extremely irresponsible that the government has not made any serious rules or regulations that attempt to limit the emission of fossil fuels. I think that while there are a lot of people who truly care about climate change and are passionate about it, there are way more people who are either ignorant, do not believe the science, or just do not care. Because of this it is necessary to find a way to make sure everyone acts responsibly that is not based on the honor system. Sadly, consumerism and selfishness run rampantly in today’s society and I agree with you and think that the government must step in and do its job in protecting our country, even if it’s from ourselves. 
<br><br>

I think that if this careless not my problem attitude continues, then California, along with cities and places around the world will continue to experience devastating natural disasters. It pains me to see that we have already exceeded the limit set by the Paris agreement to stay below 2 degrees Celsius and if we continue on the same path we are on, then these disasters will only continue to get worse. Climate Change is everyone’s problem. It does not discriminate, not on race, location, or affluence. People think that they do not have a responsibility to change because they are either still clinging to the hope that the science is wrong and nothing bad will happen, or they are hoping that enough people somewhere will change so that they don’t have to. It is time to stop waiting and start acting. Every single person must do their part, starting with those that are able to and those that are emitting the most.

<br><hr>
While you mention that this county’s policy makers aren’t fully updated on the current state of the climate situation, I personally believe this is merely their ignorance, stemming from their positions of authority that serves to represent the public and protect them. Yet how can they truly protect all people when at the basis of this ignorance are the human flaws of greed and selfishness that endangers both others and themselves, whether they are directly aware of it or not. I agree that without enforcement of such goals to reduce the level of temperature increase or emissions, their desires and good-natured plans prove worthless. As stated by Wilson, “Despite Santa Barbara’s heritage as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, the county is falling far short of its own anti-pollution goals, which are meant to serve as a model for others to follow.” If other places that are less driven and in support of taking action against climate change, then how can Santa Barbara profoundly respond to climate change while producing evident and inspiring improvement. Reading this portion, I honestly felt disappointed and discouraged that although its leaders were outwardly expressing support for an initiative against climate change, they ultimately failed to deliver as “Santa Barbara was actually exceeding its 2007 levels by 14 percent.” For what is one’s desire for change without actual action, especially when dependent on those expected to represent us and in power to do so. Even so the environmental activism that is allegedly so abundant within this county is not as effective as we may believe it to be. Currently there is consideration for a major drilling expansion from county officials, completely contradicting the side taken to challenge climate change and yet such a project would prove to be a step in the opposite direction rather than one towards progression. Learning about the history of Earth Day and climate movement here within the city and county of my own university was definitely interesting and initially inspiring; however, if those who are known to be such advocates of progression fail to live up to their own goals and initiatives, then a vision for a future of reduced carbon emission and a safe environment for all species may be even more blurry than we thought.

I had a very similar reaction as I was reading the article. It thoroughly demonstrated the flawed and dismissive nature of lawmakers and people in power, the individuals that are supposedly working to the what is best for its people. The Climate Action Plan is basically a symbolic notion that the county decided to officially acknowledge the climate crisis that has become apparent in Santa Barbara. In essence, it is a step forward to the problem of climate change, by addressing its existence. However, I felt that this lacks the major element in progressively changing and amending the issue, urgency and action. There is no motivation or demonstration of desire into proactively working towards a better future by writing out regulations that aren't enforced or followed. This is the basically the same as not creating the "plan" at all as the results are exactly the same, nothing. I feel that the bare minimum is not even being met as there is no consistent monitoring, improvement to regulations, or even incentive given to businesses or governments as the issue grows. I find this very upsetting because it is almost as they fires and temperature inversions was not "enough" to create better planning and action. I don't understand how much "larger" of a disaster is needed in order to urge change, because if that time every occurs there will most likely be nothing left to save.

After reading the whole article, I mainly discussed climate change in Santa Barbara. Although I've lived in Los Angeles for nearly five years, I didn't feel the climate abnormality or realize the seriousness of the matter before. But this article shocked me. I never thought that one in four people in California lived in high-risk fire areas. Of course, when I came to California, it was as long as it was very dry, sometimes there were earthquakes and fires. I had never experienced a fire myself before. I met it in the first quarter of my visit to UCSB. A large number of people left Santa Barbara and the school canceled all classes. What surprised me, even more, was that three years ago, an apartment building collapsed because of the corrosion of the cliff. In the past few years, the Santa Barbara goal is generally consistent with the goal of California, which is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, it was not achieved after that. Instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 14% two years later. And it's just because of some interests that the government opposes more policies. It's too ironic. It's just for some interests, but breaking the promise, just for some personal interests instead of contributing a little to the protection of the environment. As we have learned before, some of what we do now will be completely passed on to the next generation. The climate is abnormal now, and various natural disasters often happen. We can't wait. We should do something.

What I found most interesting about the Washington Post article was the section titled "No teeth in these plans." It's interesting to take note of the environmental hypocrisy that Californians have, whether in the form of Santa Barbarians lobbying for free parking and in turn, encouraging the emission of greenhouse gases by car, or the drastic affects of the oil spills of the coast's beaches. I really liked how Williams, the county supervisor, conceptualizes this behavior in a term - "environmental poseurs," because it's quite relevant to today's vapid culture of social media. Becoming an environmentalist today is not always in an effort to better the planet, but more so it has become the "cool" thing to do, something that's hip and trendy. I think this is particularly the situation in California, given the image it exudes of Hollywood and stars that are resorting to veganism, cycling, thrifting, and all these other sorts of activities that are seen as trends, when many people have been doing them for long amounts of time, yet never recognized for them. 
<br><br>


In other words, the environmental poseurs of our community have turned something that could be productive for the climate crisis into an Instagram post or Snapchat story. Morales Rebecchi said it right - there isn't anything substantive or concrete happening in some environmental "movements," theyre words  on paper that have yet to be enforced by someone who's passionate about the cause. Santa Barbara's credibility as a green county (and California as a state for that matter) is deterred in my eyes when I hear about their conscious funding for high intensive drilling operations for the oil industry. I don't want to seem like such a pessimist but the more and more I read & watch in the class, I just can't help but really only take away the flaws that we have as humans. How am I supposed to feel inspired to contribute to a county's environmental movement when they can't even hold themselves accountable?

I was also surprised and appalled by Californians’ two-faced nature. They claim they stand for one thing, they make posters and go to Earth Day rallies, they repost pictures on Instagram highlighting the devastation of the wildfires and the desperate need to create change in our environment, yet they act a completely different way. They continue to waste resources, support fast fashion, and choose convenient and polluting forms of transportation. Honestly, my actions contribute to the abundance of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, too. I think most of us could say the same thing. As a Californian, I read these comments bashing on other Californians for not prioritizing our planet and I feel a bit guilty. I know that for myself, I can take steps to prove that I care about the environment by buying second hand clothing, purchasing local goods, and choosing to walk or bike instead of drive. 
<br><br>

One of the points in the article that stood out to me the most was the impact of free parking in downtown. I never really thought about how it was a pull factor for people to drive rather than make use of public transportation. Requiring shoppers to pay for parking is a good way of encouraging taking the bus or carpooling, but no one wants to support it. And it makes sense. People don’t want to have to pay for parking when they’re just going to spend more money on high end clothing, goods, and food. 
<br><br>

You bring up a really good point: what are we actually doing about the problem? People can talk and post about issues all they want, but actions speak louder than words. I know it’s easy to focus on the flaws that people have when it comes to hypocrisy, but I think that there are individuals who truly want to see the earth’s condition improve. I hope that it won’t take an oil spill to remind us of what happened in 1969 or another catastrophic fire or a lack of food supply to motivate us to stop talking and start doing. By taking this class, at least all 800 of us or so will be more informed and more inspired to do our part.

Deadly effects of climate change are obvious, as Ken said, fewer people are asking about its’ timeline because it’s among us. Because I now reside in Santa Barbara, it really puts climate change into perspective for me. “Global warming” a few years ago didn’t mean to me what climate change means to me now. I always heard the term but was too young and unaware to realize the effects, however, catastrophes resulting from climate change are hitting closer and closer to him for me. Knowing people effected by the Paradise Fire in Northern California and having family in Ventura, the blatant consequences of climate change can’t go unnoticed. On top of wildfires happening near me, they are also happening more frequently. The fire in the Santa Ynez mountains just happened around Thanksgiving break and our classes were canceled. Being affected by climate change and taking this class where Earth Day started makes the matter all the more relevant and personal. 
<br><br>


Although Santa Barbara is painted out to be a locus amoenus of sorts, I find it interesting that there’s accusations of the Mediterranean-esque city to be more talk than action when it comes to enforcing real change. The article states, “Several government-sanctioned architectural review boards make sure the city’s breezy, Mediterranean aesthetic remains intact, supported by many staff members. But until recently, only one person was directly responsible for moving the city toward renewable energy sources” along with other criticisms of Santa Barbara’s regulations, or lack thereof. I agree with France in the article with the idea that we, as a people, are always willing to make change that cost nothing but are hesitant to make effective change that will cost something. It’s easy to say that you care about being environmentally conscious, but what are you actually doing to make progress? I guess that’s why most of us are enrolled in English 23.

After reading this article, I feel like I actually was in the danger of where I live now. Before the Christmas, we faced a wildfire near our school. That’s my first time  experienced a wildfire with such close distance. But at that time, I did not feel scared but quite interested me. I did not think it’s quite danger because I have the confidence that the school will protect us if the fire came closer to us and I never think about the fire will put me in danger or even take my life. However, after reading this, I changed my opinion. The climate change make the average temperature of Santa Barbara raised which means the wildfire would happen more often in our area. And also because of the climate change, many plants can not grow which affects we are lack of the special food and the pollution of the air also makes the climate change worser. The article mentioned the flood. We are so close with the ocean and the mountains. If one day the floods come to us then what should we do about this. People now think themselves live in a perfect environment that the disaster will never come to us. The climate change now is real in our life and is really danger to us. The environment we are living now is not as before. We have to pay attention about this.

I agree. I have lived in Southern California my whole life and have been evacuated from my home twice due to fires when I was younger, but never really took it seriously. I just figured it was a typical SoCal part of life, much like taking cover in your basement during a tornado is part of Midwestern life. However, recent events such as the Cave Fire paired with the reading of this article have really scared me. You always think "oh, it'll never happen to me" and then it did happen to us. And, reading in the article about the eroding cliffs on Del Playa Dr. made it that much more real as that is likely the area most of us will live during the next three years or so. I, for the first time, feel scared in my home as we never know what natural disaster will strike next.

Before reading the article “2°C: Beyond the limit,” I knew California was prone to wildfires, mudslides, and droughts because of climate change, but I didn’t know intense the conditions of climate change right here, near UCSB, were. Despite UCSB students coming from different cities and areas, as of now, we all live near the proximity of UCSB. Therefore, anything major happening near Santa Barbara, Goleta, etc affect us. Some narrow minded people might see the effects as beneficial or convenient. For example, when the cave fire flared up in the Santa Ynez Mountains, schools for students at UCSB ended a day earlier than expected. Some students might have seen this as beneficial or convenient because they were able to get home earlier now or just simply didn’t have to deal with going to classes.However, it wasn’t so beneficial or convenient for the 6000 residents had to leave their homes because of this fire. I found it extremely shocking when I read that since preindustrial times, Ventura ranks as the fastest-warming county in the lower 48 states. I didn’t have a specific county in mind when thinking of this topic, but I know I wasn’t thinking it would be the county that was so close to us. 
   <br><br>
 The thing is, we are already seeing affects on our community here due to climate change, yet there’s hardly any enforcement on environmental policy. For instance, along Santa Barbara’s Del Playa Drive, cliffs are disappearing with the rising sea levels. Okay, cool, whatever, some might think this is no big deal since they aren’t hearing anything threatening from this happening. But these types of things factor into something that might affect your life. For example, one apartment building that’s popular with UCSB students was condemned 3 years ago after the cliffs beneath it crumbled into the water. Now are the cliffs disappearing due to sea level rising a concern for you? I mean, this could very much affect your home, the place you live, the place you built some of your best memories of college, your OWN first place that YOU are paying for. But if you don’t believe me that climate change is already affecting people’s lives, believe the stats. 25% of California’s 40 million residents now live in high risk fire zones, that’s 10 million residents! The 3 most severe fires in California’s history occurred in the past 2 years. This isn’t by coincidence, there’s a huge noticeable reason for this...climate change. I really resonated with what Edward France, the former executive director of the Santa Barbara bicycle coalition, said, “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” To take it a step further, I would even say that we are unwilling to make changes if that change will alter an aspect of our daily lifestyle. We can't be all talk about these environmental issues, we have to do something. Let’s not just do something we are comfortable with changing, but something that takes us out of our comfort zone. We shouldn’t have to purely rely on punishments from the law to do the right thing.

 I love that you mention the attitudes of some people as seeing the fire that happened recently as an excuse to go home early for the holidays because of school being cancelled. I found this comment so important to the overall conversation about the climate crisis because it perfectly displays the struggle of privilege and non-privilege. Not everyone could get in their cars and drive home...not everyone had a home to go home to...not everyone was positively affected by this fire-as some UCSB students may have thought-it really opens the eyes about how selfish we can be at times while turning a blind eye to people in developing countries who have no access to "emergency kits" and other related ways of having a sense of security. Why do you think the common peoples are so resistant to making changes in their lifestyle? Do you think it comes from a sense of oblivion or more from a standpoint of denial?
<br><hr>
I think your point about people being narrow minded about the effects of the climate crisis is extremely relevant and a major factor in the lack of action taken to help the cause. I think that overall, society has a mindset that revolves around solely benefiting themselves and supporting conditions that support them, such as the cancelling of school due to the fires. I think it is safe to assume that victims of the fires would be more likely to contribute to a cause acting to prevent future disasters from happening compared to individuals who gained some sort of perceived benefit from the event. With this attitude, the crisis will not cease until more and more people become personally effected by its wrath and by that time it may be too late. 
<br><br>

The fact that articles like this address these issues that hit close to home is a step in the right direction for attracting peoples attention to potential personal harm. Like you said, it is easy to have known about the likelihood of wildfires in California, but bringing that in one step further to specifically the UCSB area creates more of a shock value and I think it is important in the process of creating awareness to appeal to people more personally rather than over an extremely broad spectrum. If people worldwide were exposed to information regarding their own lifestyles I believe it would be more effective. Representatives from all over the world or local politicians should act to inform their own people on a more honed in basis to create awareness instead.
<br><hr>
I agree with you 100%. When the Cave fire happened it was just a joke to UCSB students. Also, how come people aren’t worried about the houses that are on oceanside Del Playa drive ?? Recently over break a cliff fell. What if students were on that cliff? We all know DP is the party street for UCSB students and the backyards of houses on DP are filled with students on the weekends. What if the cliff goes out below students on what of those weekends ? It is dangerous and people need to realize how climate change is the key reason for all of this. I also knew that california was prone to wildfires, mudslides etc. but what I didn’t know was how fast our cities near us are heating up. Professor Hiltner said that SB got an alert for a tornado. That’s crazy!! Tornadoes don’t happen in santa barbara. That just shows how messed up the weather is because of climate change.

<br><hr>

In response to Davina Reed, I too was shocked at reading that Venture ranks among the fastest-warming counties. It’s upsetting to read about because this is so close to a new city I call home and regardless of me feeling attached to this area, it has been home to so many who are also very likely unaware of the increasing changes in environment. While this may not come off the right way in text, I am in a way glad that there is currently visible erosion on our coast because it physically depicts just some of the major aspects sea levels and climate change’s consequences. It’s unfortunate that so many people, houses and roads are this close to our coast but at the same time part of me hopes that seeing this gives people a sense of urgency over the issue. As written by Wilson, scientists haven’t pinpointed the exact reason behind why this region is heating up so much faster than others, but that shouldn’t be our only focus instead as active members of this community (I am speaking specifically in terms of people living around this county) it’s so important to educate unaware people on why this issue is a problem for them. In regard to your comment about Santa Ynez Mountain’s fires I also agree, It’s sad that people don’t think about the one’s actually heavily affected by these disasters, as to so many others it is just an inconvenience in their day or a “lucky” excuse out of something. I do wish events like this were discussed more often in school, not particularly any class but brought awareness as it opens the conversation for why things like this occur.
<br><br>


The section ‘No teeth in these plans’ was for me a more frustrating section to read about as time after time it seems the “small guys” or everyday people and organizations constantly push for change just to have their progress reversed by bigger companies and corporations. I can’t help but feel happy about statements like the one Wilson mentions about the city council having residents automatically consume renewable energy unless choosing to opt out. However, it seems tiny progress like this is always pushed back by bigger negative actions like that of the oil industry using its resources (money) to block a ban that would have directly protected it’s land by not allowing intensive drilling and steam injection. Often, hearing news like this makes it hard to stay positive and want to keep making small changes in our lifestyle we know will better this issue, personally, I find re-reading and re-watching how our consumption has a negative toll on the lives and environment of so many is what keeps me motivated to making those tiny changes.
<br><hr>
I think common people are resistant to making changes in their lifestyles because they fear the idea of their lifestyle being worse in terms of quality. They don’t want their quality of life to go down, but fail to realize their quality of life could be the same level or even better when making these eco-friendly lifestyle changes, but the fear overpowers. I believe it comes from fear, therefore it wouldn’t be sprouted from oblivion nor a standpoint of denial.

Growing up in the Bay Area, I never gave forest fires much thought. The closest threat of a fire was the 2018 Camp fire. But even that did not seem horrific. All we needed to do was not do strenuous outdoor activities to limit smoke inhalation. However, moving to Southern California for school has changed my view on that. Last quarter, there was a fire so close to campus that classes were canceled for a week (which was nice, but also scary). The article: 2 Degrees C: Beyond the Limit also brings the threat into a better perspective since it focuses on the area around us, literally next door. I think that being so close to such a major effect of climate change has been an important factor in my understanding more of what is happening and a driving force in my attempts to take actions that are better for the planet.

<br><br>

Unfortunately, I must switch gears and discuss a discouraging fact brought up by the article: that the very city that has been thought of as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement has actually gotten worse over time. I think that it is important to lead by example, but Santa Barbara is not doing this, as their greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 14% since 2007, instead of the proposed pathway of being 15% below their 2007 emissions. A part of the problem is the greed of oil companies, who have lobbied to stop the use of renewable energy, a problem that is also discussed in An Inconvenient Sequel, one of the films from the last week. It seems that money is a big evil in the quest to stop climate change.

I agree that the fact that Santa Barbara fails to set an example despite being home to some of the earliest signs of the environmental movement. Especially with a political class that is supposedly very green. It is sad to see that the business interests of the city have taken precedent over the environmental targets.

<br><br>
In response to the article, the aspects that stood out to me were the stories of the farmers whose livelihoods were and are still being threatened by the consequences of climate change. La Peloma Ranch being forced to adapt to the lack of water that once sustained their most profitable crops is an unfortunate reality. In more urban areas adaptations are also necessary, particularly areas of Southern California that have been plagued with fires. In the case of DP, there isn't a way to adapt since the buildings themselves are projected to be gone by 2060 if something does not change. Erosion, along with rising oceans, can entirely reshape the coastlines.
<br><hr>
Given that I am also from the Bay Area, I can relate to the treats of Southern California wildfires seeming far away and less destructive to our lives. While the dangers of horrible air quality and particulate matter were important to take note of in the Bay Area during the 2018 fire, they were nowhere near as scary or harmful as they were in places closer to the fire. Living in California has given me the opportunity to experience some of the impacts of these raging wildfires, but by living in Northern California, I feel as if we are looking in on the catastrophes as outsiders. Now, being at UCSB and living in Santa Barbara county, I feel more anxious and worried about the potential dangers of living in such a fire-prone area, as the consequences will be much worse than avoiding going outside and buying a mask to prevent intake of particulate matter. The threat of catastrophic fires, as mentioned in the article, is much more prevalent here, and this issue cannot be placed on the back-burner.
<br><br>

One of the statements that stood out to me the most throughout the article was put forth by Edward France: “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” Although Santa Barbara is known for its environmental awareness and movement, residents don’t necessarily feel the impending pressure to take action against climate change. Often with huge environmental issues, people feel very threatened and sometimes motivated to make a real change, but as exhibited by Santa Barbara residence and politics, no one is willing to take big steps toward big solutions. Currently, oil industries and their money stand in our way, but if we made a greater effort to care for our climate, the money shouldn’t matter. Through this, France’s statement rings true; efforts to combat climate change will cost us lots of money and hard work, but we must move past that, as they are necessary in maintaining survival on our planet.

As I was reading this article I discovered that I was really interested in what the author had to say. For one, I had no idea that Earth Day was started here in Santa Barbara. However, I do not completely agree with what the author had to say. I have been living in Southern California my whole life, however I do see a big difference between here in Santa Barbara and my home town of San Diego. From my point of view, I think that Santa Barbara is doing a great job with their emissions and being eco-friendly. I really do see the contrast, specially when I go to downtown. Comparing downtown Santa Barbara to downtown San Diego I can really see that Santa Barbara air is a lot cleaner than that of San Diego. When driving to downtown San Diego I am able to see a cloud of fog, which I believe to be smog--I'm not sure how accurate I am- over the tall buildings that make up of the skyline of downtown San Diego. Here in Santa Barbara I really don't see that. 
<br><br>
Another point that is why I don't completely agree with the author is the amount of people that use public transportation here in Santa Barbara. I have never really looked at numbers but just by simply looking around I can see that the amount of people that use public transportation is a lot larger than in San Diego. Of course I recognize that the reasons for the differences that I can see between these two cities is because San Diego is a much larger city than Santa Barbara is, however by my point of view I do not believe  that Santa Barbara is doing such a bad job at being eco-friendly as the author of the article makes it look. However, I do believe that there is a lot more throughout the whole world that can be done in order to take better care of the environment. 
<br><br>
About what Ken mentions about the alert about the tornado, before he mentioned it in lecture and in this video I had not heard about it before, however it blows my mind to hear about this because it goes to show how much climate really is changing, as this is not an event that is normal for this part of the country.

I agree with your point of view on Santa Barbara being eco-friendly. It truly surprises me that “the biggest contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions is the car.” It surprises me because I’ve seen so many people on bikes and public transportation. For example, IV is a great example of eco-friendly. The amount of people that ride their bikes to UCSB is far greater than the amount of people I know who drive their cars to school. Of course, there are are a TON of cars in Isla Vista and that’s why there are never any parking spots, but I feel like the ratio of cars to people is very low. Many house on Del Playa have about ten to fifteen people with two or three cars in the household. In my hometown, we had six cars for five people and that was pretty common for each person to have their own car. I don’t disagree that Santa Barbara is releasing a lot of greenhouse gases, because I believe EVERY city is releasing a lot, not just Santa Barbara, I just know there are many people who are at least making an attempt to change that.
<br><br>
As for the tornado, it completely shocked me too. I never knew there could even be a tornado like that anywhere near here. We already have so many other things to worry about in California such as flooding or fires that we don’t need to start worrying about tornados too. It’s terrifying to think that this is all caused by climate change and climate change is caused by us, so basically, we set a tornado on ourselves.

I lived in the midwest for my entire life, where the only time the realities of climate change were when, just last year, it didn't snow as much till late January. Coming to California is a pretty major culture shock because whether I am with my boys scouring DP for a function or looking out over acres of burnt land as I drive through the state, I realize that here, climate change is real. But, no matter where it is occurring or how subtle the changes my appear, the attitudes toward climate change, as I have found, are very consistent across the country: apathy.

The reading “2 degrees beyond the limit” explains how global warming has affected California. It was sad to read how nothing really happened in Santa Barbara until 2016 and that now, because of climate change, the new reality is that every year there is a wildfire or some kind of environmental disaster. This hits close to home for me and many other students at UCSB who grew up in California and have their lives here. I think that Californians often focus their concerns of natural disasters towards earthquakes and tsunamis but it has become a harsh reality that our real focus needs to be on destructive and deadly wildfires. I remember that before Thanksgiving break, the Cave Fire broke out and classes were cancelled that Tuesday. I was really disappointed because that day, I was actually supposed to do a presentation about the Woolsey Fire for my Geological Catastrophes class. Fires have become such a prominent feature of California in the last couple of years and it is all because of the fact that the climate is becoming hotter, drier, and windier. 
<br><br>

Learning about how the loss of moisture and the growing heat threatens the redwood trees was so disheartening to me. I remember visiting redwood forests when I was younger and I really want to be able to take my kids there as well. Furthermore, the fact that, at this rate, erosion would take up to 78 percent of Santa Barbara’s bluffside beaches by 2060 is devastating. Because of this erosion, there was an apartment building on Del Playa that crumbled into the water. Knowing what Isla Vista and Del Playa, in particular, means to UCSB students, the loss of this residence is incredibly saddening. We need to step up and mitigate climate change so that we can protect our city and all of the wonderful things in it.  
<br><br>

I think it is fairly clear that the climate crisis is here and furthermore, it is going to get worse before it gets better. During winter break, there was a tornado warning for Santa Barbara, but there was also one in Orange County, which is where I was over the break. I remember being home alone because my parents were in Florida and it was late at night when the warning was issued. I immediately went on social media because I literally had no idea what to do. I remember looking online and seeing jokes on twitter talking about how this is California, not Kansas and how the only thing that we know how to do is duck and cover. We’ve talked about how we are in the sixth extinction event both in this class and in English 22 and I think it’s starting to become more clear on how the climate is going to play a role in destroying parts of our planet and killing so many people. We have to put pressure on politicians to make substantial changes and put pressure on each other to consume less because at this point, taking shorter showers and turning off the lights when you leave the room is not enough.

This week’s reading “2 Degrees Beyond The Limit” presented the growing concerns of the the effects of climate change that pertain specifically to the area we as UCSB students call home. Living in California my entire life makes the negative effects presented in the article shocking and worrisome. The difficult reality that we have to now accept with the changing climate is unfair to those that are working to create positive changes. I completely agree with Romi when she states that Californianians often focus on earthquakes and other natural disasters when the real growing issue is the growing common occurrence of wildfires. The term “harsh reality” very clearly represents that people may be naive to turn away from the spreading problem right in front of them. It is much easier to ignore the rising temperatures and claim that we as Californians will always have wildfires, but when looking at the facts presented in the article it is clear that things will only get worse. Additionally, the focus on California in the article states how those that reside in California and specifically Santa Barbara will be affected, but the reliance of the entire United States on our agricultural production makes it a problem for the entire country. Like Romi, I also had school cancelled due to a different fire in my hometown. Due to the severity, I did not have school for a week but did have to deal with the burdens that come along with a serious fire. Over my four years in high school, I can remember five fires occurring, two being very serious ones. The fact that this has become a reality and will likely not get any better in the near future is beyond horrifying. The state that I have called home my entire life is in serious trouble, and even with counties that are committed to being sustainable like Santa Barbara struggling, I am apprehensive that any change can be made at all. I resonate with Romi’s point regarding the significance of Del Playa and the detrimental effects of erosion. My friend’s homes on Del Playa are hanging on by a thread. Romi couldn't have said it better. We as a community have to step up to protect the things that are such a big part of our culture and significant to our city. Like Romi, this class really opened my eyes to how we as a species are going to lead to our own extinction like the five species before us.

<br><hr>
Your comments about this article really struck me. As a resident of California myself, I like many of my fellow Californians, have witnessed the effects of climate change on the seemingly fragile Californian ecosystem first hand. The growing frequency of fires such as the paradise fire discussed in the film have always struck me as a topic of great urgency. I used to marvel at how everyone seemed relatively calm after each consecutive fire claiming they were "a normal consequence of the dryness caused by the Santa Ana winds." No one seemed to call attention to the fact that the fires were growing in frequency and magnitude with each consecutive year, and, as a consequence, it felt as though we were to simply accept them as another hazard of living where we do, much like we think of earthquakes. I used to believe this myself until my first year of high school where I read a poem about California weather. The poem depicted the fires using words such as "apocalyptic" and "catastrophic," eliciting genuine panic within me for the first time in my life with regards to the climate crisis. A few years later when I first heard Greta Thunberg actually say "act as if your house is on fire, because it is," her words struck me with the same panic I had felt before; however, along with the terror came a slight sense of relief: someone was finally standing up for our generation. 

<br><br>
What I personally have begun to realize more and more as the climate crisis and myself mature simultaneously is that this catastrophe is not happening far away, in a foreign country, to people I will never know. This crisis is happening now, here, and its happening to all of us. When I am an adult I want my children to be able to go to LA and see the beautiful museums and art, not the charred remains of what once was. I want my kids to go to UCSB, and not just for an underwater tour of the school swallowed by the sea. It is hard to imagine a world without such beautiful sights such as the great barrier reef and the amazon but it is impossible to imagine a world without home.

When reading this article, I was reminded of many of the events you spoke about. When the cave fires before Thanksgiving break broke out, I was actually in class when we received the warning. As all of the phones in class went off providing us the details, most of the students seemed at ease since, “The fires from the previous years were much closer”. This is the sad reality of living in Santa Barbara now, fires are to be expected. This became even more apparent when the article addressed the fact that “Santa Barbara county has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius”, of course there would be more fires with this increase in temperature. 
<br><br>


The more striking thing mentioned in this article that you brought up was the effect these fires are having on Santa Barbara residents. The difficulty of growing produce in California is already quite high with our deficit of water. Adding to this fires that ravage the land and leave some in near constant states of recovery, farmers have no choice but to adapt. This came in the form of producing more exotic crops that can grow in these harsh conditions. It's also sad to think that a few decades from now places like Del Playa could be off limits to due to the ever increasing danger of erosion. Situations similar to this will continue to happen and will not slow down unless direct action is taken, not just the cheapest, newest stalling tactic.
<br><hr>

The article "2°C: Beyond the limit" truly emphasized how dire the situation was becoming with global warming, and how its repercussions weren't going to affect anybody but ourselves. I agree with you, Romi, that the climate is going to become much worse before it gets better because the people standing with the power to change things aren't going to stop until they're forced to. Parts of the planet are definitely going to suffer in larger quantities than others, especially when it comes to second and third world countries, but it bothers me that Ventura is one of the fastest heating places in the world, yet frankly hasn't made near the impact that other cities have. After reading this article, I realized that my kids in the future if I chose to have them wouldn't be able to see the college I loved for four whole years, and that's a really sad thought, the idea to sacrifice due to the politicians of the world killing it signal handedly.

I think it's important to note that we are now starting to experience the effects of our previous generation’s mistakes, but people continue to be misinformed of what the climate crisis truly entails. In California alone, there have been droughts, fires, mudslides, strong winds, heavy rains, and now even tornados. All throughout California, the temperature has already risen above 1°C and will continue to rise. The recent fire season seems to bring a new fire every week and in the past, there have been apartments in Isla Vista that have fallen to erosion. The extent of the climate crisis does not end there as we now know, but the sheer fact that one community can experience multiple within a few days is still a little hard to wrap my head around. Truly no place on Earth will be left untouched. 
<br><br>
It is ironic how the Environmental Movement started in Santa Barbara yet compared to other places, it seems to not be doing enough. Santa Barbara has experienced a 2.3°C increase since 1895, and as a result, is now dealing with intense fires all year round. After the oil spill, many of the residents became environmentally conscious. However, despite the constant support for the environmental movement the residents of Santa Barbara claim to have, no real concrete actions have taken place, according to the article. Now I don’t want to criticize this county but it is weird how they preach to be this yet allow for future oil projects that will surely have a drastic effect on the environment. It seems that they care for the climate crisis on paper, but nothing is actually enforced with hard laws. But then I remember that it is those in power who fail to make the changes and not the people themselves. There are so many groups on campus and in the community that actually do have plans to change the way we live into a more environment-friendly one. So, it is incredibly clear to me that more actions need to take place, it is not enough to simply say that one will change but must actually make the effort to.

Yes, I completely agree with the irony that you have come to realize after reading this article. It is interesting to think about the fact that I learned in many of my environmental studies classes here that Santa Barbara was the birth place of the modern environmental movement. I remember even talking to family members about this feeling of being immersed in this environmental consciousness in the amount of time I have been in Santa Barbara. Yet, I was never aware of this notion of the "no teeth in these plans" (as Rebecchi describes the situation) here in our county. I also especially like that you point out that it in our own campus and surrounding community, the push and success to mobilize as a method of fighting the lack of hard regulations is clearly evident. I am curious as to whether you think such mobilization even makes an impact in encouraging those in power to make changes and what further actions we could be taking.

Since the first time I arrived at Santa Barbara, I believed that it is one of the cities that are the most suitable for living. However, the article “2°C: Beyond the limit” by Scott Wilson astonished me. The article focuses on the climate change and the abnormal climate changes in Santa Barbara, which is exactly the city I live in. I realized how close a natural disaster can be. Right at UCSB, a whole building has sunk due to land erosion, and according to Professor Hiltner, a tornado was reported that might strike Santa Barbara. I also recalled the wildfire that spread on the mountains of Santa Barbara last year, and the severer one, told by a chemistry professor, in 2017. Although, fortunately, neither the tornado cell nor the wildfire last year caused fatal damage to human, a great number of wild animals has been killed during the fire, and the aftermath of the fire might last so long that some of the survivors starve to death. These unnecessary deaths are not just caused by natural climate change, but the abnormal rise of temperature and drought caused by human actions. The overuse of water resources leaves the whole California drought, and the heavy traffic of the north-south highway. 
<br><br>
It is quite ironic that the city with the best climate has been experiencing great change and disasters. People might not recognize the little changes happening every day, and a rise of 2 degrees in temperature is hardly noticeable. But the consequences are already starting to emerge. We must be aware of the climate crisis we are potentially facing and do whatever we can to save the areas we live in from severer damage before we human beings become the victim. However, one problem we are facing is that people tend not to make even just a little sacrifice, such as taking public transport instead of driving, or simply consuming less animal products, for slowing down the temperature increase that we cannot directly observe. In this case, the local government should impose reasonable taxes on products such as oil and animal products.

I had some very similar reactions when reading this article. Santa Barbara is such a beautiful and happy place; obviously, I know that climate change is a big issue here (as it is Southern California), but I never would have guessed that Santa Barbara is basically the poster child for the horrid effects of climate change. Two stats toward the beginning of the article especially jumped out at me. One, that the coastal curve from Santa Barbara to the Mexico border is warming twice as fast as the continental U.S. (and even quicker now). Two, that the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees C. This is my home, so this is really scary. I am also shocked that more hasn’t been done to fight the causes of climate change in the wake of the 2017 Thomas Fire, in which 23 people were killed by mudslides, the result of fire and rain. There is a huge gap between what leaders in Santa Barbara say about helping the environment and what they do. For example, the oil industry seems to be unbeatable in Santa Barbara from what I have read in this article about practices like fracking and steam injection. SantaI hope that the climate crisis gains way more traction in Santa Barbara and fast because the city needs change now.

After reading the Washington Post article for this week, I was taken aback by how the issue of the climate crisis is impacting my home region, Southern California. One line from the article that had initially struck me and with which I wholeheartedly agree is “Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote” (Wilson). This one line has directly called so many people--including many of us readers--out for ignoring and failing to recognize the danger and pressing nature of the problem of climate change. Despite what the news report on the television and articles published online regarding climate change and its consequences, a majority of people are still struggling to even acknowledge climate change as an existing, valid environmental concern and to shift their perceptions towards climate change by providing the amount of attention and efforts that this issue deserves just like any other political or socio-cultural issues that most people tend to focus on. 
<br><br>

The philosophy that many follow is that as long as climate change has not affected my home and my loved ones yet, then I would not need to worry about it. In their opinions. Climate change surely is an important matter of concern but it is still fairly remote and far away to their daily personal lives. What they neglect is the fact that climate change is closer to their lives than they have anticipated and it is arriving to affect their lives negatively at a rapid pace. However, just like professor Hiltner had pointed out during his lectures last week, climate change does not discriminate and it is truly a global concern that would negatively impact the entire planet and no place on the planet would be untouched by the consequences of climate change when it starts to dawn on the people living on earth. 
<br><br>

Being a resident and having lived in southern California for these many years, it could be said as almost a shame that I did not realize how much climate change is taking place right in my backyard and affecting my home region in negative, unprecedented ways. If I had not read this article, I would have never even dared to guess that southern California is on average two degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times. For example, in my home county Orange County alone, the temperature has risen 2.1 degrees Celsius on average compared to pre-industrial times, and this is a shocking statistics to me. 
<br><br>

Additionally, the Washington Post article has explained that Ventura and Santa Barbara counties are the regions that have experienced the most drastic warming over the years that Ventura County is ranked as the fastest-warming county in the lower 48 states in the U.S.. Over the period from 1895 to 2018, Ventura County has an astonishing increase of 2.6 degrees Celsius in temperature, and Santa Barbara County has an increase of 2.3 degrees Celsius in temperature, both compared to the national average of 1 degree Celsius and across the globe. The consequences of climate change are already starting to surface in those regions, including the Thomas Fire, unusual rain seasons and rain amount, extreme droughts and hot days during summer, and many other frequent extreme weather patterns that are becoming the norm and affecting and reducing local crop and agricultural production. The local farmers have no other choice but to adapt to this unpredictable extreme weather by planting exotic crops and installing equipment to prepare for those weather hazards. 
<br><br>

Coastal erosion is another example of the impacts of climate change that the coast is eroding at a pace much faster than normal due to ocean acidification and soon the houses and infrastructures built on top of those cliffs would no longer appear as the cliffs are completely eroded and vanish as a result. This is just purely unfortunate as the breathtaking views of the beautiful Santa Barbara nature would not be so available to its residents. In fact, as people continue to sit by and take no actions towards climate change as it continues to worsen, people living in the beautiful coastal cities such as Santa Barbara will have to evacuate and leave all of this wonderful nature behind as this place becomes inhabitable with the impacts of climate change.

Being a Santa Barbara native, the numerous fires and drought that have come in the 21st century are quite significant.  As a young child, I only heard of the old painted cave fire in the 80's, but from 2007-present there have been tenfold the amount. On the shore I've seen a large increase of stingrays. I saw the increase in the last several years, and even with declining tourists we've experienced more and more sting ray attacks, with one day having 9 sting ray attacks in the Santa Barbara harbor, which was nearly more than the number that I saw the whole previous season. The tourists stopped hitting the beach too because of the massive amounts of dead kelp washed up onto the beach as the water temps warmed which attracts bacteria. Those who get out enough will experience the change firsthand rather than shrugging it off as a distant problem.  Santa Barbara is the creator of earth-day and we do have pride in being clean and green, having banned smoking in the downtown area and providing accessible bus routes around the majority of neighborhoods, but sure, we could step up our role instead of strictly aiming to keep our town quaint with the tourist industry.

I found 2 degrees beyond the limit to be a very interesting article. It has some underlying class bias. It often talks about the wealthy neighborhoods of Santa Barbara and how they are impacted by our changing climate but I saw no mention of how it affects low-income communities in Santa Barbara. Is it because climate change is only important when it affects the wealthy? or is it because it didn't affect any low-income communities at all. Why is the focus on the wealth of Santa Barbara and not the rich Spanish history it has to offer. I've read many climate related articles and most of them mention how climate change is impacting the poorest communities the most. It's mentioned always somewhere, even if it's just one sentence. Despite that, I also found it interesting how the temperature is continuing to rise in Santa Barbara and Ventura more than anywhere else. I see so many Tesla's everywhere, long lines at whole foods, a strong variety of farmers markets, bike paths everywhere, and electric fleet of buses, and yet the temperature continues to rise. Could it be possible that the temperature rise is a result of not just Santa Barbaras emissions but our neighboring cities as well. The article briefly mentioned this. Perhaps Santa Barbara is reducing its emissions but is geographically impacted by everyone else's emissions the most, resulting in a rise of temperature. Just food for thought.

This article outlined the disastrous effects that climate change is having in our own home, and it's terrifying to come to terms with it. The data presented to us clearly stated that the intense weather changes have happened only in the past few years, so for us to deny the presence of these disasters is asinine. Here in Santa Barbara, we are in a vulnerable spot: on the coast with the mountains on the other side. When a fire occurs, we're nearly trapped in between. If we don't take immediate action, we will be the first in the lower forty-eight states to suffer. 
<br><br>
A statistic from the article that shocked me was the fourteen percent rise in emissions AFTER the Paris Agreement, when we promised that we would keep emissions under a two degrees celsius rise. Of course, making sustainable changes is difficult when the government has their own vision, one that's focused on monetary gain and less about impending dangers. However, matters will get worse if we wait for someone in a government position to advance us. 
<br><br>
I moved here over a year ago from Northern California, where it is much dryer and temperatures are usually consistent with the seasons. Last summer, my hometown experienced some of the dryest, hottest days they've had in years. With the heavy dust from agriculture and the fires that scorched nearby towns, their air quality was unhealthy and they were encouraged to stay inside at all times. I've grown up there for 18 years and that's never happened. Here, too, fires and other disasters have great potential. These weather patterns are becoming more unpredictable, as Professor Hiltner mentioned there was a tornado threat during the holidays. Something needs to change before our home is too far gone.

The article "2 C Beyond the Limit" really does shock me since I had no idea that climate crisis is happening so quickly in the area I live and probably will put some of my friends and people I know in dangerous situation. It is a hard thing to think of that Santa Barbara is one of the cities facing highest rising rate of temperature, as this should be a mild, beautiful, and comfortable place for all residents and visitors. However, now it is suffering from global warming crisis which caused mountain fire and lead to side effects of flood, and both of which killed lives. People living in potential fire areas have to evacuate several times in just two years, and this has never happen to them before. Also, the pretty coast side building might disappear every time when there is an alarm. Farmers have to think of their future, to think of what substitution for fruits such as avocado which they have grew for their whole life time to deal with the water shortage. It is depressed to see that resident has put in so much money to set up protective equipment to prevent fire problems but find out it does not work since they were out of power. 
<br><br>

All of these are caused by climate crisis, global warming effects, and it is so sad to see that we actually does not have any workable solutions to deal with such situation. People are always willing to do something which cost nothing, but when it cost something, people would choose to do nothing. This sentence in the article touched me and revealed how selfish and foolish people are. When things seem not related to their own life, they choose to do nothing and forget that as soon as they started to realize the harm of global warming, everything will be too late.

It's one thing to see the devastating effects of rising temperatures in remote places such as Greenland or the Poles, but to become aware of the catastrophic magnitude of climate change in my own backyard is not only a shock, but carries a chilling warning of what's to come. What struck me when reading this article was that it all of the information seemed completely foreign in a sense. I am well aware of the tar that plagues the Isla Vista coastline, the massive spurts of fires in previous years, and the subsequent mudslides that killed 23. However, these things always seemed oddly normal, routine even for for California living. I had absolutely no idea they were the result of human error and signs that the Earth was dying a slow death. I now realize this is because the climate crisis has been at the height of its severity for my entire lifetime. I grew up amidst a climate crisis and I didn't realize until very recently that the fires, droughts, and sporadic weather conditions which were normalized in my mind, were not in fact, normal. I grew up in the hilly mountainside of northern Los Angeles and have experienced 5 major fires that came so close to my home, parts of my backyard were singed. In 2008 my town had to be evacuated due to a massive wildfire, and I can remember the thick haze of smoke as teachers led me and the other elementary school students through the already ash filled hallways. My point is, natural disasters have always seemed standard and cyclical for California living and I am just now realizing how alarmingly untrue that is. I am upset at my oblivion to what's happening, quite literally, in my own backyard.

Like Ken says in the video, the climate crisis is here. To those of us that have seen it first hand, we can find it hard to believe that there are people in our country/world that still don't believe in global warming and the climate crisis. I believe this is down a similar path as the generational video from last week and how people that aren't directly affected immediately may not truly see what is happening around the globe. This article describes the real truth about the decisions people in our area are having to make to save their livestock, livelihood, and lives. When I saw the map of California in relation to the rising heat, I was shocked to see Santa Barbara in the worst section of the state. I was even more shocked to see that Ventura county has the largest annual temperature change in the continental US. Mind blowing facts. And that brings me to my next point, the word facts.
<br><br>


While people's opinions are one thing, something I've learned in the 2 short weeks of this class is that there are tons of facts to back up the idea of climate change. it makes you wonder if fires like the ones in California were happening in DC and destroying buildings and houses there, if our president would be telling people to be raking the leaves off the ground. Just a thought.
<br><br>


The climate crisis is here and we are seeing examples of it more and more every day.

I completely agree that the time for trying to discover and decipher the facts and figures of climate change is an endeavor of the past. If people cannot understand, not only with numbers but with the physical visuals that are created by our heating planet, then I cannot help them. And I do think that it is all dependent on perspective. I like how you brought up the idea of Washington DC. Sometimes, people cannot empathize with others due to the simple fact that they do not know what it is like; they have no prior experience of being in a similar situation, and therefore, have no connection or relation. Because they don’t hold a connection, they simply do not care. And that is the problem. Our administration does not look at our people and sees them as his. When President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January of 2017, he promised the American people that he would be a president for everyone; not just for the people who voted for him; not just for Republican supporters; not just for people in the Midwest; for everyone. Yet, in typical President Trump fashion, he has gone back on his words and looked to only what benefits him the most. He has consistently denied the effects that climate change has on our planet. Yet, just because he has not felt them or seen him (which, by being the President of the United States, traveling the world for foreign affairs purposes, and through discussing with fellow world leaders, I find extremely bizarre and ignorant) does not mean that he cannot sympathize with the people that he promised to be a President for. Just as the city of Santa Barbara has gone back on its promise to reduce carbon emissions in the 8 years they said they would do so, the President continuously turns his back on the people that need the support his policies can make. I guess broken promises are just a trend nowadays.

<br><hr>

I strongly agree as I also find it hard to believe that there are still many people that do not believe in climate change. I especially liked the part where you stated, “it makes you wonder if fires like the ones in California were happening in DC and destroying buildings and houses there if our president would be telling people to be raking the leaves off the ground.” Many people do not believe climate change because they do not see it first hand, and since the climate is not negatively and personally affecting them, they believe that it is all a hoax. This is similar to last week’s information about how, since people do not see the downsides of harming the planet (but the next generation will), there is no need for them to panic. In addition, while I was reading the article, I was especially shocked because this article talked about Santa Barbara, the place where I currently stay. Since this article focused heavily on places where I am, I was especially nervous about the future. This made me think of the question: If we do not change our lifestyle,  how many more years does Santa Barbara have until it is unhabitable?

<p>
What stuck out to me about the article 2 degrees Celsius: Beyond the Limit was not the fact that we are already in our home state seeing the negative effects of climate change, but how little we have done about it.  You would figure when fires are raging within our county and strange weather patterns are occurring more and more frequently, our local government would act.  But instead they take the politically tactical option, selling environmental conscientiousness to the public while following through on none of their promises, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and giving in to the oil industry sitting just off our coast.  As dark of an opinion this may be, I wish the effects of climate change would hit us hard and fast today.  Yes wildfires are awful, yes the destruction of our marine environment is deeply worrisome and yes there will be many more worse effects than what I have listed.  But if that is what it takes for people, and by extension their politicians, to wake up and realize this is not an issue we can fake commitment on, then that is what must happen.  A slap in the face now is better than being burnt at the stake later, to make a bit of a gruesome analogy of it, and I believe that the vast majority of self centered Americans will not act until their ways of life are directly being threatened by their own actions.  As said in the article, "people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world — something important but remote."  This kind of thinking is so misguided, but it will take something drastic to get that way of thinking out of the mind of the naive wealthy residents of our county.  They believe that climate change is an issue they can "take a stance on," by simply stating their environmentally conscious opinions while acting on none of them.  If only what we did today hurt us today, and not 60 years in the future, we would undoubtedly have changed by now.

Your opinion is dark but completely understandable. And I think you’re right, honestly. People don’t feel like addressing the problem until it’s staring them in the eyes. And you would think that now, with fires and mudslides being an annual event and the annual temperature rise of 2.3 degrees Celsius, that community members would finally realize that the consequences of climate change are upon us. Yet still, Santa Barbara fails to follow its own climate directives. So many politicians will run on a platform claiming to care for the environment, but when fossil fuel interests start leveraging money, their platforms are crushed by the heaps of profit.
 <br><br>
If our actions (more like nonaction) on climate change were to have immediate consequences, the movements in our government to stem greenhouse gas emissions would most definitely be much quicker. However, with the direct effects of today’s actions not to be seen for a while down the road, politicians see no real reason to act. Their job is to make their current constituents happy, not the ones in 50 years. They won’t be in office anymore, so it won’t be their problem. We need to see these wildfires, these tornado warnings in Santa Barbara(!!!), and realize that here, in 2020, we’re only seeing the beginning. It’s going to get much worse. And that should frighten us.

It is so easy for one to completely ignore and put their problems to the side but you could only ignore things for so long until it comes back to bite you in the ass. This is exactly what we are seeing here. We are all aware that climate change is a global issue whether you believe it is happening (because it clearly is) or you want to continue to tell yourself it's a hoax (it clearly isn't). But although we are aware of it we keep putting it to the side, especially those who have yet to experience the consequences first hand. There's this quote from the article that portrays a perfect example of one being blinded by climate change until it hit home: “before the fire and flood, people thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world … now im comfronted with the fact we had a mass casualty event that was climate enhanced.” Just because one hasn't experienced catastrophic events due to climate change does not mean it isn't happening or it isn't your problem, because in fact, it is a global problem. 
 <br><br>
Everything is also easier said than done. It is so easy for one to say that they will change their diet to a plant based diet to help the environment, or to ride a bike instead of a car, or to get politically active, whatever the alternatives may be, not everyone is involved. A quote from the article states “you know it is coming, but you are not preparing.” The shoe definitely fits for me on that quote. I have attempted to take some steps to change my lifestyle for the better of our earth but I could definitely do a lot more. How many of us have sworn they would change their ways to make a difference but have yet to do anything? I'm definitely guilty, are you?

This article created a different feel than other articles that I’ve read about climate change. The main reason is because it’s describing the harsh consequences of climate change on a place that we live, Santa Barbara, and its surrounding areas. Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius, and Ventura County ranks as the fastest-warming county in the Lower 48 states. It’s a scary thought that UCSB could be greatly impacted by climate change because it’s such an important place to all of us. Even as a first-year here, I’ve experienced the consequences with the Cave Fire in November -- a sad reality that in just 8 weeks, I’ve seen the points laid out in this article play out before my eyes.
 <br><br>
 Another relatable topic covered in this article was free parking. According to Wilson, “studies have found that there is no greater predictor of the number of cars on the road than the availability of free parking.” As my friends and I were looking for parking the other day on State Street, I was really surprised to see that the first 75 minutes of parking were free, followed by only $1.50 for each additional hour. For a place like Santa Barbara, I would’ve thought that parking would be expensive, or at least definitely not free. Apparently the concept of free parking is greatly contributing to the fast-paced warming in this area because in Santa Barbara County, the biggest contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions is the car. It makes me more concerned about climate change knowing that my education and the place that I now live could be greatly impacted by this warming and sea level rise.

I agree that this article hit different. By describing the impact the climate crisis has on our immediate surroundings, it makes it feel a lot more real (not that it wasn't in the first place, just that it feels a lot more immediate). The fact that it mentioned how most of Isla Vista probably won't be here/be safe to live in a couple decades from now is a big reality check. Living through both of the SB fires mentioned and seeing how it impacted the lives of some of my friends, family, and professors is really scary. And the fact that it seems as though fires/disasters like these are only becoming more common; "The three most severe forest/wildfires in state history — measured by acreage burned, homes destroyed and lives lost — have happened in the past two years," is really alarming. I think the mention of Santa Barbara natives/neighbors/civilians having to come up with their own plans regarding what to do/who to help/what to save in the event that another fire occurs is also concerning- I know that the county has evacuation centers set up, but with fires/natural disasters such as this occurring more and more often, it seems as though the city/county should make more of an effort to share fire safety/evacuation information with the civilians and make sure they actually know the protocol as to what to do in an emergency.
<br><br>
I also agree about the parking- I had family visit this weekend and we were all surprised that it costed more to park on campus for a couple hours than to park downtown for the entire weekend. Especially in big/wealthier cities like Santa Barbara, you'd think they want to charge a lot for parking- so the fact that they don't incentivees a lot of us to just drive our own cars instead of use public transport/bikes/walking/etc. which increases our carbon footprint significantly.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you -- the city of Santa Barbara should definitely make more of an effort to share safety/evacuation information with the civilians. This especially holds true because Santa Barbara has been at risk before. With the Thomas Fire and recently the Cave Fire, SB is most definitely at risk for a natural disaster. As for me, I really don't know what to do if we got evacuated. I'm not aware of any major alert systems either...

It’s sad to see the investment in security around our campus, and the lack of response due to that investment. For us students, seeing the bluffs around us fall apart is depressing. We have a truly beautiful area around us students, and the fact that it is falling apart due to our inaction is sad. Simply, we are not alone, and we will be experiencing some of the least damaging results of this change. The farmers which are impacted due to the fires around us as well as other homeowners in Carpinteria have already been hurt. I hope that we can do a better job protecting the area around us through both investment and climate action.

Before I actually talk about the article/video, I'd like to take a second to point out the disparity between the comments on these videos and the opinions expressed on the anonymous polls in class. Nearly every single comment here seems to be in support of the information being presented. However, once in class and hidden by the glorious shield of the nameless IClicker polls, a large number of disagreers tend to appear. Why is this? Shouldn't we just be honest here and have discussions with our differing opinions in order for all of us to reach a better understanding of this topic? Anyways...
<br><br>


As someone who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I can distinctly remember the time before yearly wildfires became "the new normal." Other than the occasional small grassfire, I can't recall a single fire that affected my part of the Bay. However, around 2015, things started to change. At first, these wildfires would strike during the summer months, which seemed relatively normal since our hills were relatively drier during these times anyway. Over the next couple of years, these fires would continue to start until the late fall and early winter months, which then led us to realize that maybe something about these patterns. I personally didn't make this connection until I was affected twice in 2018, when my house was merely feet away from being burned down, and when I had a nearly life-threatening case of pneumonia caused from the Camp Fire smoke (keep in mind that this fire was over 150 miles away from where I lived).
<br><br>


When I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend UCSB, I thought to myself that I would have the privilege of attending college in a place with one of the most desirable climates of the state, if not the country. After reading this article, I can officially say that the rose-colored glasses have come off. With a recorded temperature rise of 4.2°F/2.3°C, it's starting to become clear that this beautiful landscape and weather may not be the same for much longer. Although I was already aware of the erosion along the cliffs of DP, I wasn't aware of the fact that nearly 78% of these stunning beaches may be gone within the next couple of decades or so. It's honestly sad to think that future residents of this little coastal town won't have the same experiences as us simply due to the gradual warming of our climate. That being said, I'm surprised that the residents of Isla Vista/Santa Barbara have had some apathetic reactions toward the possible destruction of their cities (whether it be due to wildfires, coastal erosion, etc.). It almost seems as if we love to talk and talk about implementing measures to combat climate change, but when it actually comes time to do it, the conversation becomes quiet. 
<br><br>


After all, it's always easier said than done.

It's interesting that you bring up the point about the iClicker polls because I was thinking the same thing when I was looking at the spread up on the screen this past Monday. Speaking from my experience only, I have found these assignments to be eye-opening but make me feel more and more negative about this issue that seems to have no solution, unless everyone is on board. That might be why people are optimistic on these comments, but realistic when answering polls. I agree when you say that it's important for us to have an honest conversation online, even if we disagree with one another, it can definitely be hard when an identity is associated to an opinion for sure. 
<br><br>


As a Bay Area native myself, I too remember a few instances over the past roughly 5 years where fires had started to affect the area. I live close to the Sunol hills/Mission hills in Fremont. When I was younger, I remember the hills being relatively green during the late spring early summer and then drying to a golden brown during the summer time because of the heat. In recent years, however, I've noticed the browning of these hills far earlier into the year. Along with this indicator, I know that in the recent 2-3 years, we have had a few actual fires/scares that have caused us to shut down schools because of poor air quality, have led to evacuations, and have caused scheduled power outages in the Berkeley and Santa Cruz area to prevent more fires. I cannot believe that all of this has occurred over the span of just the last 5 years (an estimate). I remember my parents telling me how hard it was to breathe outside, and hearing that many people struggled to just go outside in my hometown was heartbreaking. 
<br><br>

Similarly, I was a first year when the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara occurred. This was the first instance I had lived through and so close to a natural disaster (if a fire constitutes one). There was literal ash falling from the sky, free masks were being given to residence halls, and the sun looked as red because of the smoke and flames. It was truly astonishing how much an area had changed as a result of a fire. And to think, California has these fires all the time,  to the point that farmersthat were mentioned in the article are prepared with a fire protocol and are already thinking of switching crops to return profit back to what it used to be. We're seeing that climate change is not only a public safety and public health concern, but it has started affecting the revenue of entire industries. For those who put climate change on the back burner and place other issues at the forefront like defense, economy, and such, we're seeing that climate change is in fact affecting the issues that many prioritize. Maybe this is what it will take for people to realize that it is an issue that has reverberations in many different ways.
<br><br>


I thought the part of the article regarding the Santa Barbara specific sentiments about why legislation isn't being passed and how officials are just sharing the sentiment but not taking action was particularly interesting. I'd be curious to learn more about why officials do not think they can affect change at a local level and whether it is past just the SB government's involvement with the oil industry (which I didn't know before hand, but explains the oil rig off our coast on campus).

The reading really puts into consideration the harm inflicted on animals due to rising temperatures of ocean water. It should be known that there is a continuous cycle of animals being affected. For instance, there is a lack of food for marine life coming from the inability of crab and oysters to grow and develop. Both crab and oyster are prime sources of food/sustenance for marine animals. Reading on how beached whales are found not only dead, but with no food in their systems comes to prove how there is something negatively influencing sea life, and that all starts with them needing the right environment to thrive. 
<br><br>

After watching Ken’s video, listening to how the average temperature in Santa Barbara County warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius literally hit too close to home. We are constantly exceeding scientists’ expectations on warmer climate. This type of extreme weather in such a location that is not usually susceptible to tornadoes comes to show how the climate crisis is a global struggle. All parts of the world are being affected with unusual catastrophes stemmed from climate change whether we know it or not. Reading about the Santa Barbara Thomas Fire and how many humans failed to see the disastrous extent of its power on the hillsides discourages me in regards to the fight against climate change. 23 people were killed from fast-moving stream spawned from rain after the fire, due to their belief that there was no need to evacuate their homes. It is ironic that this type of mindset occurred amongst individuals who live in a community that focuses on environmental matters and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

thank you for sharing your thoughts. At the end of the fall quarter, there was a wildfire near the highway.  I failed to realize natural disasters like these are a byproduct of climate change in Santa Barbara county. .
<br><hr>
I really liked how you brought up how animals are also suffering the consequences. It is devastating to know that rising temperatures  are affecting ecosystems. The part about the whales in the article also struck me. The other day in one of my other classes, I learned about how important whales are for marine ecosystems, so it is very unfortunate that they have been found dead with no food in their systems. 
<br><br>
The article really did hit close to home, before reading the article, I honestly had no idea about the extreme temperatures in Ventura. As Ken mentioned, Santa Barbara and the neighboring areas are expected to have a very nice temperature, so I was shocked to learn that Ventura ranks as the fastest warming county in the 48 lower states.

One thing that stuck out to me most from the article was the quote saying “Before the fire and flood, people here thought of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world” It was important but remote so not really our problem for the ignorant citizens but now it’s on our backyard making us realize the real dangers of climate change. The natural disasters happening happening along coastal California are abnormal and people are finally taking notice leaving us to do action that might be already too late.

I agree with you that people do not respond to issues unless they are present for their own eyes to see it. But I would like to still believe that we are not too late. I am very shocked and sad about the tragedies that are facing Santa Barbara but there is still so much that can be done to improve this situation. I think the "Sherpa fire" was the first main fire that occurred in June 2016 which was the beginning of the reoccurring wild fires. Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara county has warmed by 2.3 degrees and as a response thirteen whales washed ashore with empty stomachs as the rising temperature is causing animals in the water to migrate away taking away food sources. 
<br><br>


I worry that with the gradually increasing wild fires every year in Santa Barbara will all of Santa Barbara to be in flames. As in 2017 when the Thomas Fire burnt 281,000 acres in SB, and then a year later 23 people died in Montecito also causing two billion in damage. It is also scary that in IV the cliffs of Del Playa are disappearing and supposedly by 2060 that 78 percent of the beaches cliffs will not be in the same position as they once were.

Reading this article really made an impact on the way I look at California and it’s changing climate. As a lifelong Californian who loves to enjoy all the great places this state has to offer, the topics brought up by the article really made me question the longevity of many of the idyllic paradises that exist here.
<br><br>


For example, the article mentions how increasing temperatures and a lack of moisture is already threatening California’s beautiful coastal redwoods and the Joshua Trees that inhabit one of our many great national parks. Additionally, many local gems are also vulnerable to climate change, with the article stating that up to 78% of Santa Barbara’s amazing beaches could be eroded as early as 2060 due to rising seas.
<br><br>


Not only will the ecosystems of all these amazing places soon be altered and possibly destroyed by California’s changing climate, but much of their allure will also be lost, as the changes these locations see will surely lessen the appeal they have to many outdoor lovers. A reduction in those enjoying these places will be especially negative I believe, because the grandeur that many places have give people the appreciation to want to care about and save through a reduction in our footprint. My fear is that if great California landmarks are damaged by climate change, it will give us less to want to care for in a time when we need to be caring mightily for our earth.

I have also lived in California all my life and now reading that my new home, Santa Barbara, is facing detrimental problems for everyday living is heartbreaking. All of the damage California is facing is anthropogenically caused and we continue to deface the Earth by repeating the same actions as the generations before us. As you mentioned the great places you enjoy in California, it is upsetting to realize that these same places are experiencing a transformation in the weather for the worst: the climate is growing hotter, drier, there are extreme droughts, and in some areas including our beloved Santa Barbara, intense wildfires. 

<br><br>

Like many others, I always saw climate change as a far off concept because I couldn’t see the detrimental effects first hand. When the Thomas Fire occurred in 2017, people in Santa Barbara were finally realizing that climate change is real and is happening. Understandably, it was difficult for people to grasp an intangible concept that humans have that much power to affect the Earth. The facts are showing that we are the problem. We’ve experienced the more severe wildfires in state history: “measured by acreage burned, homes destroyed and lives lost.” People are packing up their lives and leaving their homes in fear of what the weather is doing in effect to us.
<br><br>


I also like how you pointed out that if these California landmarks are ruined that we would care less about the Earth since we have already damaged these beautiful areas. This interested me because we are damaging the Earth, yet we aren’t changing our ways. I wonder if people see the damage and think to themselves “well too late to make a change.” We are still ravishingly using fossil fuels as our main source to live and large steps aren't being made towards change, the world is full of people who are selfish and this selfishness may be the cause to the detriment of the world.

In the reading “2 degrees beyond the limit” it explains the impacts of climate change on forests in southern california. Bowman says that since 2016 wildfires have been an annual occurrence. I was shocked to hear this because climate change can increase so much in 4 years, and this trend is only going up. Before reading this article, and being from New York, I have always thought of California as a state where temperatures are consistent. The article states that from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles the climate is warming at double the rate of the continental United States. This is proven to continue and be if we don't change anything it will be catastrophic. I remember about a month ago I went outside my dorm and saw that the mountains we look at everyday were on fire. Luckily it didn't cause too much damage, but if the temperatures continue to rise this will cause more fires which will destroy the mountains we look at and will cause harm to UCSB.

I agree with you that our climate has changed so much, and we can directly see this by many wild fires in California. Before reading the article, I think two average celsius change will not cause too much damage to the environment. While the truth is that, the small amount of temperature change has caused a lot of problems. The thing shocked me most in the article is that climate changes make California drier than before. Many farms suffer a lot from this climate change. Farms need to use irrigation system to grow plants, and it is more difficult for farms to make profits. Dry days cause more wild fires, and wild fires cause a huge loss to both people, animals and the environment. I still remember the big fire in Malibu in 2018. That big fire burns a lot of houses down. Many infrastructures were broken through this fire. In Australia, a wild fire causes death of many animals like Koalas and Kangaroos. Loss of animals also cause imbalance in the nature. Furthermore, wild fires happening in Australia brings air pollution to major cities like Sydney. We must stop this trend otherwise it might cause more serious problems. However, promises made by governments sometimes did not come true. Santa Barbara promised that it would reduce greenhouse gas year by year, but it turns out that the greenhouse gas did not reduce but to increase. All government should take practical action instead of making useless announcements.

Being from Norcal I have always seen LA/ Socal as a hot, crowded, awful place to live, but when college applications and visits came around UCSB was nothing like I thought. I loved visiting Santa Barbara and couldn't wait to live here. Where I am originally from, in my opinion, we do not experience drastic weather conditions. We have our hot summers and cold winters, and actually experience all four seasons! That is not the case here in Santa Barbara, for one it is January and I am wearing shorts still, fall like didn't exist at all, we only had a couple rainy days and we had a fire. The fire up near Cachuma was the closest fire I have ever been to, sure we had fires up North, but they were more than 50 miles away. The first real experience I had with a wildfire was right here in Santa Barbara, within three months of living here. It does not surprise me that Santa Barbara/ Ventura County is heating faster than anywhere else in the 48 lower states. I still can not get over the fact I can walk outside in shorts and a tank top and be fine. Back home I would be in long pants and puffy jackets by the end of September. 
<br><br>

This article was not wrong when it approached issues of wildfire, erosion, crazy weather, and politics. Too many people in this world would rather make a profit than look out for the Earth they are living on. It just doesn't make sense, even our own survival is going to be affected by decisions we make now.

When I went home for Thanksgiving break, I saw a glimpse of wildfires on the hills lining the freeway. It was terrifying to see a fiery red wall against the hills, knowing that it could quickly spread and take so much more land with it. I was born and grew up in Northern California, surrounded by lush green hills dotted with wind turbines. To me, drastic weather events have always felt like such a foreign concept. When I saw events like the Tubbs Fire on the news, I never thought I would see a wildfire anywhere except for my living room TV, let alone in real life, through my own eyes. This was a naive assumption, and reading this week’s article made me realize that the climate crisis will impact California much more heavily, and more quickly than I imagined. 

<br><br>

Something that shocked me while reading this article was that the climate in Santa Barbara and other parts of California, like the Central Valley, can no longer grow staple crops such as avocados. Instead, they turn to crops more accustomed to the climate such as dragonfruit, coffee, and finger limes. When I envision any of these crops, I immediately picture a hot, moist tropical climate in a country far, far away. It is so shocking to realize that we have changed the climate so drastically that crops once unable to grow here are now the best economic choice for this area. Another aspect of this article that alarmed me was that Santa Barbara has painted itself to be a champion of “green living”, yet does very little to actually combat climate change. I feel that this is precisely why other countries criticize the US as a whole, for claiming to care about climate change, yet doing almost nothing to stop it.

I find your recollection about how you reflected on the current effect that climate change is having on California resonating as I remember a similar recollection. Living in Northern California, I remember about a year or two ago, the shocking experience of breathing in the ash that would intoxicate the air across the Bay Area as wildfires burned slightly north from where I live. The air quality got so dangerous that school was canceled and it was during this time that I realized the climate crisis was already upon us. Because of the droughts that often affected California, I knew that the climate was changing for the worse, but this experience was the first time I understood the effect that dramatic wildfires, caused by climate change, can have on huge populations in local areas.
<br><br>

In relation to the article "2 Degrees C Beyond the Limit," my recollection of my experience of climate change in my hometown area connects directly to what Wilson is conveying in his article about how climate change is affecting the Santa Barbara coast in more ways than sea level rise. I think that throughout his whole article, the part that resonated the most with me is how the increasing temperature and smog  are helping to burn off the marine layer faster than normal and contributing to making the coastal climate a drier one than before the industrial times. This is then a large part of why wildfires have increased across all of California as the dry climate has made it easier for dead plants to catch on fire which then rapidly spreads as the combination of wind and dry air and terrain contribute to helping them spread at fast rates. This article helped me realize this effect of climate change and others that affect coastal California beyond the surface level of sea level rise.
<br><hr>
I agree with this in all aspects. Never have I experienced something like the fire in the Santa Barbara hills that took place in November. Although it was not close enough to directly effect myself and my friends, seeing the fire with my own eyes and not through a television was genuinely frightening.Driving to my hometown while the fire was happening another fire was happening in LA county that I also saw on the side of the freeway. Two visible fires in just one day that were unconfined for long periods of time. It is no surprise at this point hearing about fires and I think it is important to stress that what used to appear as natural catastrophes are just everyday weather now. The reading touches on good information like the pictures of weather changes and other things like crop and vegetation information. 
<br><br>

I also thought it was interesting and validating that the article mentioned how Santa Barbara claims to be a green county but does nothing to actually live green. Santa Barbara is a wealthy county that can definitely make changes to support more green ways of living, transportation, and more. We at Isla Vista and at UCSB I feel like are very much more aware than other places on the climate issues. All IV restaurants are now composting their food scraps and left over food for the growth on farms in local Santa Barbara farms which will greatly benefit all vegetation and crops that are growing around us.
<br><hr>
Yeah.... I 'm totally agree with you, not only with your experience, but also your opinion about the article. For me, the place where I come from is extremely hard to see a wild fire, not to mention such a large scale one that happened in Santa Barbara last Thanksgiving break. I used to hear that California always has wild fire every year, but I never expected that I would see it in my life. However, by the time I saw it, I was completely astonished by it. The wild fire light up the sky, making the night nearly like a dawn. Fortunately, the wild fire didn't spread across to campus. From that time, I start to imagine that if next time the wild fire happens on campus, where should we go? 
<br><br>

After I read the article "2 degrees beyond the limit," I start to realize that temperature is actually increase more rapidly than I thought to be. Moreover, the disasters brought by the temperature rise is numerous, including lack of conditions to grow crops, increasing possibility and severity of hurricanes. Why does these issues matter is that there are a lot of crops growing in California. If California is no longer has the ability of growing such amount of crops, what the country should do?
<br><hr>
I really enjoy your perspective on this article. Actually, interesting enough, as I was reading the article, I was constantly relating it back to my  hometown as well. However, I had a slightly different view. I'm from Yosemite, CA (which is more North than South in California) and for the past 4 years our town has seen devastating fires that have wiped out  plenty of homes and ruined beautiful landscapes. Also, just like the article was mentioning, there then comes heavy rain in the winter creating mudslides in the river canyon. The threat of driving and being injured by a mudslide was all too normal for us. Crazy enough, since my town is mostly very conservative, I never heard anything that these natural disasters that have killed members of our community was because of the climate crisis. It's just unbelievable to me how people are normalizing these life threatening issues. 
<br><br>


Another thing to keep in mind about the "staple crops" in California is that since we are losing the ability to grow these crops in this state, there is going to be a lot of food shortage all the way around. Like Hiltner said in his video, California produces so much crops for the rest of the country and when we are not able to grow these crops anymore, food supply is being threatened. Now, because these farmers can't grow these crops, they are starting to lose money. Someone in class today mentioned this idea, but if people make so much money by profiting off of the emission of greenhouse gases, why can't people start to make money by creating more clean energy, or in this case, saving these farm lands so that there will still be a good amount of food supply.

<br><hr>
Like what you have described, I have also personally witnessed the terrifying reality of wildfires affecting my life. In my sophomore year, the 2017 Thomas Fire burnt up many parts of Southern California, making it the largest fire in the state's history. Although the Isla Vista area was luckily outside the evacuation zone, many parts of Ventura County were paralyzed by the flames. When I left campus for winter break, I could see billows of smoke engulfing the mountains on the left side of the road. I had always regarded Santa Barbara's weather as one of the nation's bests, and I would have never thought that we'd live to experience such a catastrophic scene.
<br><br>

The article "2C: Beyond the Limit" actually mentions the concept of "Global Weirding": that is, as human-caused climate change accelerates, we are not only seeing more warm days, but also more erratic events such as fires, snowstorms, and mudslides. I believe that UCSB will unfortunately face many more of these threats in the upcoming years, and if this doesn't wake people up to the challenge of reducing emissions and repairing damages, I'm afraid that nothing will...
<br><hr>


Coming from Southern California, I am unable to fully relate to the green lush scenery that you come from, but I can relate to the fact that I, too, never fully realized how serious the climate crisis was to all of California until I took this class and read this article. It is absolute mind boggling to think that places such as the Central Valley have ceased to grow crops natural to the area, and now have to grow such things like coffee, which I personally only thought could grow in the most tropical of climates like South America. I absolutely agree with what you stated about Santa Barbara and its "green living" mission; the county does almost nothing to increase sustainability and eco-friendliness within the area. Santa Barbara consistently cares about how it looks to the public, but it clearly doesn't care enough about actually living up to its word as our greenhouse gas emotions have barely been decreased. It angers me to live in a place that tries so hard to make itself look good in the eye of the public, yet exhausts its effort by doing this and thus doesn't follow through with their word.

This article and video were very eye opening for me because growing up in Bakersfield, CA I would frequently hear about fires occurring but it all seemed very distant, even though the air quality would get so bad and many of us who grew up there developed asthma. What really captured my attention in this article was how many species we have lost and are continuing to lose with the article stating that 43% of desert species were lost in the past century. What also is very alarming is the change of natural disasters such as increasing strength in hurricanes, an increase in wildfires or even tornadoes which Ken states in this video and which are a foreign occurrence in California. This is worrisome because many people are not prepared for these completely unfamiliar disasters and would not know how to prepare for these events. And as the climate continues changing I do not know what to expect in the upcoming years in terms of these natural disasters and deterioration of many species.

 I can remember quite well that about a year ago when I flew back north to the Bay Area for Thanksgiving break, I arrived home just a day after the smoke from the Napa fire had stopped filling the air, now just a year later, I was able to look outside the window of the bus I was in, and I was able to see the Cave Fire burning on the hilltops. 
<br><br>

Now that more intense fires and other devastating weather events have become frequent occurrences here in Santa Barbara after 2.3° it’s hard for me to think that devastating effects like these will soon be the case for the rest of the world (if they aren’t experiencing them already) in the near future. 
<br><br>

I wasn’t aware actually how slow Santa Barbara was in becoming green after I heard so much about the ambitious goals of our campus on becoming completely carbon neutral. It seems like the typical story that I’ve heard before, lobbying by (in this case) local businesses, strong clout from the oil industry. I expected more from this city. Though I have said this before, what is important now is that we raise people’s awareness of why their neighborhoods are now suddenly being burned down by unprecedented fires. On this local level it is important for us, to help people make connections between these disasters and the inaction on climate change, or no progress will continue to be made toward ending the crisis.

Reading this article truly shocked me. I always read about how the climate has been increasing at an alarming rate and it is causing disastrous effects such as rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. But, I never thought that the climate crisis would reach me so directly. I have lived in Southern California for most of my life and the amount of extreme weather events in the past few years especially have been drastic and impacted people everywhere. I am a first year here at UCSB so I wasn’t a student during the Thomas Fire but I heard horrific stories from students about how they couldn’t see anything in front of them, breathe air without a mask, and how everything was covered in ashes. California has had some of the most dangerous and biggest fires ever in its history in the past decade and this issue is going to continue getting worse as we do nothing about it. Obviously I want to be optimistic, but after reading this article I realized how much politics has to do with how climate change is seen and talked about. Nothing will change unless politicians confront this issue and understand the long-term impacts of fossil fuels in Santa Barbara and around the nation and world.
<br><br>


The most shocking statistic to me in this article was, “Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has warmed by 2.3 degrees Celsius, according to The Post's analysis. Neighboring Ventura County has heated up even more rapidly. With an average temperature increase of 2.6 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, Ventura ranks as the fastest-warming county in the Lower 48 states.” With many issues (climate related and other) people don’t realize how big it is unless it directly impacts them. And this, definitely impacts us directly as we have seen with this extreme increase in temperature in Santa Barbara and Ventura. On top of this, a few weeks ago we all got a message about a possible tornado hitting Santa Barbara. To me, this was absolutely absurd. I honestly thought it was a joke. I would never have thought tornadoes occur anywhere except the Midwest, and now the idea of them reaching here is one we have to take into account.

I am truly ashamed to admit that, before taking this class, I was not fully aware of how dire the climate circumstances are at the moment. I, of course, understood that there were definite issues and saw the effects of climate change happening in other places, but I did not realize the extremity of the situation, and how close to home these problems truly are. It is a saddening thing that people, similar to me, are ignorant of the magnitude of some global issues until it affects them personally. Having lived in California all my life, I am aware of the usual (and environmentally necessary) season of wildfires. However, the duration and intensity of this season has been much increased by the dryness of the environment due to the climate crisis. It is terrifying to realize these massive fires could erupt at any moment, anywhere in the state, a previously very unlikely occurrence. Further, these climate issues have brought about an even scarier and more uncommon concept: tornadoes in Santa Barbara. To have such a rare destructive weather formation occur in this area is a perfect example of the severe consequences of the climate crisis we will only be seeing more of as the global situation worsens. Not only do these new weather patterns affect the residents of California, but so too the entire United States, as, like Ken mentioned, California is responsible for supplying almost half of the produce of the entire country. If this land is struck by a devastating tornado, or is scorched in an all-consuming fire, then the entirety of the country will be at a loss. With events like these only beginning, it seems as we are entering an almost apocalyptic time, one in which we must take action now to have any hopes of preventing.

Reading this article hit home for me. Reading about the fires and floods that I experienced in my first year was devastating. I never realized that these weather conditions were so unnatural for Santa Barbara. I assumed, since every year that I have lived here some extreme weather incident happened, that it was normal, so I was so shocked to learn that this only started in 2016. Another thing I never considered was the state of all the crops in Santa Barbara county. When the article brought up all the dozens of crops, homes, resorts, and wildlife that were destroyed, it really hit me that these people did not just get to return to their homes they had to deal with these unfair consequences. I was also shocked to learn that the county had pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas production and instead went up over 10%. It is sad to see that people can recognize a problem but let greed and self-interest in the way. This is climate change, it is right in our face, it is hard to come to terms with the fact that people are choosing to ignore all the signs right in front of them.

thank you for sharing your thoughts.  Similarly, I did not realize wildfires and temperature rise at Santa Barbara was abnormal. Take the wildfire that occurred at the end of the Fall Quarter for example. It never occurred to me natural disasters like these were a byproduct of climate change.

I have little to no experience in Santa Barbara, or rather California in its entirety. It is difficult for me to compare how life here has changed over the years as I simply have not experienced it myself; however, I did move to California from Illinois with a false idealistic perspective. In a childish way, I almost felt as if California was an untouchable paradise, far to progressive, bountiful, and beautiful to be afflicted by the climate emergency. I was wrong, of course, though I was wrong by a much larger extent than expected; within the first few months of living here, the Cave Fire occurred.
<br><br>

The effects of climate change in Northern Illinois, where I lived for much of my life, were very evident; white Christmases became infrequent, then stopped altogether. There were periods of extreme and unusual drought in summer paired with torrential rainfall that damaged swaths of corn and soybean fields. Just last year, January of 2019, temperatures were the coldest they have been in 34 years, dropping to under -30 degrees. These changes are ones that I experienced firsthand and could see the connection to the changing global climate. Not only are these changes observable from the lifespan of our professor, they are observable in our own lifespan, and evidently intensifying. 
<br><br>

The effects of the warming planet are being felt everywhere. As students at UCSB, we can observe these changes from a privileged standpoint; I’m sure some of us interpreted the Cave Fire in December as less of climate threat and more of a means to not have class. Even with a catastrophe so close to home, we aren’t nearly afraid enough. Apparently, neither are the county’s officials.

As I was reading this article, I found myself thinking "Oh, I remember this" and "Oh, I remember that" due to the fact that I have lived in Southern California for basically my entire life, and I am glad you mentioned how climate change has affected other parts of the United States. I have never thought twice about what it has been like in states that normally get snow every year and have temperatures that drop below fifty-five degrees. The only effects that I have experienced are the Thomas Fire and Woolsey Fire mentioned in this article. 

<br><br>

Over the past few years it has been extremely upsetting to witness my friends leaving their homes not knowing if they will be able to come back to them or not. Fortunately, I have never had to evacuate; however, I had found myself excited that school had been canceled for the day due to fires that had no direct effect on me; I think if I was forced to leave my home I would have had a different perspective of the fires than I have currently. Having said this, I completely agree with your statement that we have been able to watch these catastrophes from a privileged point of view -- I know I have. 

<br><br>

Additionally, I was completely unaware that the place that I have called home for the last eighteen years is considered one of the fastest warming counties in the United States. It is sad to hear that the people of Ventura County, people that I consider friends and family, are suffering from unexplained additional rises in temperature, BUT I do have faith that at some point, we will be able to reverse these effects and save one of the only places I have called home.

<br><hr>
I also moved to California around four years ago. In no small part, my change was partially due to climate change. Frequent tropical storms caused the local economy to worsen and infrastructure to fail. We fled to California which seemed like paradise, and it was, at least for a while. We moved during the winter where everything seemed good and beautiful. Living in San Diego, I got the opportunity to go hiking every weekend and get to familiarize myself with the area. Then the summer came and LA started burning. It felt like every day a new part of LA was on fire. We thought it was normal for LA, but assumed it was contained around that area. 
<br><br>


One year passed and the following Summer we had to be evacuated because San Diego County was on fire. For the first time in the history of my town, it was evacuated. All the trails that I loved around the Julian area burned down. It was honestly devastating. I have pictures of before and after and it truly breaks my heart. I can only imagine how the people from Paradise must have felt.
<br><br>


What I learned from reading this article is that there is no escaping climate change. No matter where you go, we are all in this together. Some areas will get hurricanes, others fire and in our case, the loss of our iconic cliffs. Climate change is an issue that sadly no amount of money will fix. We need to start prioritizing our survival and the future by simply making good on what we have promised as a community.

<p>
 I strongly agree with every point ZB mentioned in the comment and it inspired me a lot. Here, I would like to conclude the comment into three main parts and demonstrate each of them.
 <br><br>

It is true that there are still lots of people believe that climate change, or global warming, is largely hyped. Many deniers of climate change are tycoons of some companies, such as oil companies. They refuse to take action against global warming mostly because it violates their interests. Therefore, they spend a lot of time and money to win people's hearts. Many people who do not know the truth are thus misled. I do not think it is proper to treat global warming as merely an environmental issue since it is mixed with many political and social factors.
 <br><br>

Secondly, more than the rise in sea levels, there are more serious problems following global warming. What I didn't expect is that since 1895, the average temperature of Santa Barbara has increased by 2.3 degrees Celsius(although this data might not be necessarily accurate, the temperature rise is unquestionable). Therefore, people are now looking for crops suitable for high temperatures and drought conditions(eg: agave). Moreover, rising temperatures cause loss of many terrestrial(like redwood forest and Joshua trees) and marine species(like kelps, oysters, crabs, and urchins). However, we cannot always be able to find another suitable crop to plant. When the temperature reaches the tipping point, people will get nothing to plant and nothing to eat. Just as Ken mentioned in the video, California produces almost half of fruits, nuts, and vegetables grown in the US. If there were significant change in the climate of this region, it could have profound impacts on the food supply and security of the US. If we consider this example seriously and take a look at the whole world, it might be a warn to the whole population on this planet.
 <br><br>

Last but not least, it is true that most people are willing to change if and only if it will cost them nothing. For example, cars are the main source of pollution and greenhouse gas in Santa Barbara. However, only a few people are willing to take public transportation or bikes, while others can usually find excuses for themselves.
 <br><br>

“Do you think we are responsible to save the planet?”
<br><br>
“Sure, absolutely.”
<br><br>
“Are you willing to drive less, eat less meat, and buy fewer things?”
<br><br>
“I need to think about it…”
<br><br>
 
A lot of people are still so short-sighted. They only care about how to gain happiness right now but do not understand what the real long-term happiness is. However, after taking the lectures by Ken Hiltner, more and more people are aware of global warming and ready to take actions to save our world.

What shocks me most is the fact that we are the neighboring county next to the county that has rose fastest in temperature. Going to school here at UCSB opened my eyes to a lot of "Go Green" movements. Almost everyone at UCSB seems environmentally aware. However, it seems that we didn't make it better, we actually made it worse with temperatures rising 2.3 degrees celsius in Santa Barbara County alone. In the article it also mentions that in about 20 years, we might not even see the houses on the oceanside of Del Playa. Del Playa will just be a story you hear from alumni. The cliff has already started falling where someone's house/backyard fell. 

<br><br>

Last fall I experienced my second wildfire, the Cave Fire. I walked outside and saw that the hills were scorching red and I honestly worried me that if I go back home for break if my house in Isla Vista will even be here. I also experienced a fire in 2017 in Santa Rosa which destroyed many homes. I even had to evacuate. Santa Rosa weather is usually not that hot, and some even blamed it on the lines of PG&E, but it could've also been because of warm temperatures.

As a UCSB student, this article hit a little close to home. Normally, when we consider the climate crisis, we view it in a broader sense - the sea levels are rising, the ice caps are melting, catastrophes are happening, but because they are happening far away, we don’t care enough to change our habits. But they are happening right here in Santa Barbara. We are seeing fires burn away the wildlife, cliff erosion bring down entire houses, and raging storms that lead to mudslides. I would not be surprised if the homes on Del Playa collapsed from erosion over the next few decades. There are tangible consequences of climate change happening in front of our eyes; I was shocked to find out that the coast stretching from Santa Barbara to Mexico is warming at double the rate of the continental U.S., and wildfires have been growing larger and more damaging as each year goes by. This itself is evidence that climate change is a problem that affects everyone, not only those who live in poorer countries. 
<br><br>
The stronghold that the oil industry has over politics and the environment is worrying, and it is a major problem that must be addressed if we want to make any progress towards reducing carbon emissions. Oil companies should not influence whether or not counties can switch to sustainable energy sources. One of the quotes from the article that resonated with me was “We’re always willing to make changes that cost nothing, but never willing to take steps that really change things and that will cost something.” This quote captures why the oil industry is so maliciously powerful; making the switch over to sustainable energy sources will be difficult, in some places it may be expensive, and the expenses from transitioning to cleaner energy may be more than if we continued using oil. But in the long-run, making this transition will have a far greater benefit as future generations won’t suffer as much from the poor choices made by past generations.

I am also disgusted on how the oil industry has such power over politics. While these oil companies don't care about whether or no they're ruining our planet, these politicians need to step up and think beyond money.

A tornado warning came to residents of Santa Barbara. A literal tornado. This just demonstrates how wildly we as a society are ill-equipped to handle the climate crisis that we created. 
<br><br>
What’s even more concerning is how the climate crisis will continue to affect our food supply. With extreme weather conditions pushing temperatures higher and higher, we must find ways to adapt our eating habits. While farmers in the Central Coast are switching from water-intensive avocados to agave, which will protect their revenue sources, not everyone can or wants to drink lots of tequila. I guess my biggest concern is what will happen to essential crops like wheat, corn, and soy when even Washington state is too hot to grow them.

With this recent occurance of a tornado warning being sent out to Santa Barbara residents and one touching down in Ventura Harbor, people can visibly see the climate crisis effects at home.  These are no longer issues around the world affecting people in far away lands, this is where people live, eat, and play with their children.  With this happening, there is no way around seeing that the climate crisis is here, and it is hitting hard.  Hopefully events like this tornado will really make people see that the climate crisis is an issue, it is changing our world, and our homes are no longer safe because of it.  There is no more avoiding this urgent issue.  Recognizing the issue is the first step, then once more people see the dangerous impact of the climate crisis there is a better chance that they are more willing to get on board with movements to help combat the climate crisis.  People need to take a stand and fight to protect their homes because if the problem continues to worsen then they will lose their homes.
<br><br>

I agree it is very dangerous.  The food supply of the US is very reliant one farms such as those found in Santa Barbara, but with the climate changing and created conditions within which much of the food we grow is not viable then we will have to turn to other foods to grow that can withstand the conditions.  Already there are farms doing this, but they are growing plants such as agave.  However, agave is used to make tequila, which isn’t exactly a viable food option, so the food supply is being reduced.  With the climate changing in other locations around the US that are used to grow food to supply to all the US, food security will continue to decline until we, as a country, aren’t sure where our next meal will come from.

Upon reading the article, I immediately thought of the year 2018 and how it profoundly affected me personally. I have lived in Los Angeles almost all of my life, and that year was the first that I had realized how immense the fires had gotten. Whenever I think back to 2018, I remember going to school every day, seeing the fires not too far away and being able to even smell the smoke from where I was at. It was crazy to me that Terri Bowman referred to the wildfires as an “annual event”. It seems almost apocalyptic and is honestly very terrifying to think of wildfires as a normal thing. It’s terrible that we don’t want to make changes if it costs us something, when in reality it will actually benefit us in the end. It’s ironic how many of us refuse to change our lifestyle or make sacrifices to better the issue, but we will be the ones to suffer if we don’t do anything now. 

<br><br>

As a first-year student at UCSB, I’ve come to really love Santa Barbara and the ocean right by us, but it’s so sad to think about how rapidly the cliffs by the beach are disappearing. The climate crisis is affecting us in many different ways, and it’s really unfortunate to think that even Santa Barbara, which supposedly has a predominantly green electorate and political class, lacks to follow through with any changes in their environmental decisions. If the fires aren’t enough to bring awareness to how serious the problem is, then what will be?

Similar to you, I didn't fully comprehend the effects of climate change until it personally affected me. The widespread fires from 2018 are merely one example of how humans are harming the planet, and this article has helped me realize how there are so many more negative impacts than I initially thought. Knowing how I was able to relate to the events from the article and learn more about climate change, I'm sure people across the globe feel the same way in that they fail to understand the severity of the situation until it actually happens to them. As mentioned by Das Williams, Santa Barbara County Supervisor, “before the fire and flood, people here though of climate change in similar ways as they thought of the refugee crisis in other parts of the world-- something important but remote.” This is dangerous considering the delayed effect of the consequences from global warming, so not everyone will feel its ramifications until it is too late. It’s almost unreal to think about how Ventura County, which is not far from Santa Barbara, has been heating faster than almost anywhere in the entire country- by 2.6 degrees Celsius. This article really puts things into perspective and forces me to think about the repercussions from climate change that are happening right now.

“The cradle of the Earth Day movement is confronting the consequences of a warming Earth.”
<br><br>
How ironic. The biggest supporter of environmental protection cannot even protect itself from heating up. If it’s not in Santa Barbara, maybe we could have excuses to regard climate change as “something important but remote” according to the article. However, we are right here in the middle of the county, with fires and storms and collapsed hillsides annually going up. The climate change cannot be more obvious these days and it’s not simply affecting our lives, but rather, devastating where we settle. 

<br><br>

Throughout the passage, the authors focus on several hot-debatable issues in the region, such as warming, wildfire, sea level rising, free parking, etc. The scope also extends to broader social issues, like the resilience of people, the conflict between environmental protection and politics, and the economic loss of the agricultural industry. All of the severe facts make me feel relatable. I may not experience the Thomas Fire, but the Cave Fire last November made us cancel classes and thousands of people had to evacuate the area. I may not perceive the sea level rising every year, but the fact that the famous apartment near the cliff will be left endangered shocked me. I may not understand the complicated political battle on environmental issues or certain interests, but I can clearly see the drill horse every morning when I look out of the window to the shimmering sea...Everything is not remote. Climate change is seeping into our daily life, our local environment, and larger, global affairs. Therefore, the article gives me a more thorough interpretation by connecting the seemingly big terms to local life.

I also agree that climate change is here and now and that the affects of it will only become more obvious as time goes on. I find it ironic that a city whose cornerstone is that of environmental stewardship is getting caught up in such technical details. I hardly think that free parking is going to matter when the parking spaces are under water, or if its too smokey to even visit downtown Santa Barbara. I think that a lot of people are misguided which is causing them to miss the big picture; they are comfortable making short term trade offs now for long term detriments.
<br><br>

The climate crisis is being felt all around the world, but I would agree that Santa Barbara has a way of really making the climate crisis known. I am originally from Washington state, where fires are incredibly uncommon and where our climate is getting milder, not scorching hot. To learn about the fires that have ravaged this area has been terrifying and heartbreaking, but I also think that it should serve as a road map for other regions with similar climate. If Santa Barbara is still filled with the same environmental passion that it was in 1969, then it has me questioning why more is not being done. I of course understand that there will changes to people's everyday life, but there has to be if a future worth living in is going to be created. I think its high time, that not just Santa Barbara, not just California, but that globally people would realize that the trade offs we make today can make or break our future on this planet.
<br><hr>
I definitely see the irony in Santa Barbara being deeply affected by climate change since it is known for pioneering Earth Day and being openly supportive of the environmental consciousness movement. Your point about climate change being not remote is entirely true. It almost feels as though the Earth isn’t giving us an option or not whether we want to “believe” in climate change or not. It’s demanding that we do something about it, or else. 
<br><br>


The picture of the cliff on Del Playa resonated with me too because as we know, some of these effects are a result of things that were done before our time, yet we are faced with consequences. With this in mind, we must live in a way that attempts to stop climate change from escalating not only for our lives now, but the lives of our future kids and grandkids.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said. Climate change is changing our life or even destroying our life. I am really interested about the irony part. It’s creative and help me have deep impression on this topic. And after read all of this, I still feel that people will not understand the danger until it is stating them right in the face.

<br><hr>

I agree, there is no need to ask when climate change will occur because I feel like it has become very clear that the effects are surely occurring via the recent Amazon rainforest and Australian fires. And just as you have said, I agree that even though I haven't personally been affected by the amazon, australian, cave, and many other fires, the effects they have had on people and consequences the tragedies will be for the future still weigh heavy on my conscious. 
<br><br>


As a Freshman at UCSB, it still shocks me that I am living the luxury of being in Santa Barbara everyday. The beauty of this area stuns me and the thought of climate change destroying it is extremely upsetting. In the article “2 degrees beyond the limit” it says that the number of extremely hot days will likely double by 2050, and I can’t help but imagine the new incoming freshman in the years coming to attend UCSB and encounter tornado warnings, a dying ocean, and treacherous weather. That is not the environment I wish upon any incoming student and I can only hope in the coming years this terrifying statistic will not become a reality.
<br><hr>
I agree with everything you said in your comment, especially about the pure hypocrisy of Santa Barbara county and their approach to reducing emissions and taking steps to prevent further warming. I find it funny that even the biggest supporter of fixing climate change hasn't been doing anything to prevent it from continuing which raises concern. I believe Santa Barbara county, a county deeply affected by the change in the Earth’s temperature with the increasing number of wildfires, should be one of the first in the nation to take drastic steps to improve our environmental awareness and become a role model for other counties in California to follow. I also agree that the article had a sense of relatableness to it, as we as UCSB students are really feeling the effects of climate change whereas students from other universities may not be which shows the need to become more environmentally aware now more than ever.
<br><hr>

I am excited to have all you guys replying and expressing the same feeling as mine. We are always regarding climate change research and protection as jobs for professionals and scientists, whereas it is right here right now happening around us. We know the weather is getting drier, but we don't know when will be the next fire, which county will be affected by the next storm, or what is the new plan for emergency evacuation. Right on this past Monday, I volunteered for the on-campus environmental activism group CALPIRG and went to their core meeting that night. The harsh situation for fracking, renewable campaign, and other related areas happening in SB shocked me and updated me with a clearer overview of what is going on now, what can be done, and what should be done. So if u guys are interested in helping SB, or at least our campus, get better, our school has vast resources to reach out, and there are more same-minded students than you think!

"If a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling or unable to change, who will?"
<br><br>


I found this bit from the article to be quite unsettling. Santa Barbara is known to be have beautiful (and consistent) weather patterns. However, more recent climate patterns are telling a different story: the Thomas Fire ravaging through hundreds of thousands of acres, two storm cells developing a tornado that almost touched down... At the surface, Santa Barbara residents seem to take a great interest in maintaining the "mediterranean" aesthetic and its crystal blue waters, though it shows that little is being done. Despite Earth Day's roots in Santa Barbara and a population that tells a progressive, environmentalist story, greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase in the county. As the article mentions, you can't help but to think that if the "predominantly green electorate and political class" won't change, then no one will. 

<br><br>

Living in Santa Barbara now, I can see kind of see why pushing aside climate issues would be quite easy. Besides the occasional natural disaster emergency, life seemingly goes right back to clear blue skies and sunshine. However, this is completely false as the whole article outlines how climate change has severely affected this area and will continue to do so. Unless some major planning occurs and we figure sumn out, our lack of action will fuel the next wildfire and culminate the next tornado that will ravage through Santa Barbara.

This reading hits especially close to home for us local UCSB students. To hear about something so devastating now be an annual threat to life in Santa Barbara is extremely unsettling. The shifting climate in southern California that’s making the weather hotter, drier, and windier is only adding fuel to the threat of uncontrollable wildfires. For me, this is a natural disaster that I’ve had a lot of experience with being from San Diego. I understand how alarming and rushed this situation is. I remember as a little kid being woken up in the middle of the night by my parents telling me that we needed to evacuate because of fires and to pack a bag with my most important items. So, the fact that four out of the five worst fire seasons of the past half-century have burned in the last two decades along the region from Santa Barbara to San Diego is heartbreaking. Fires don’t only set ablaze the hillsides, but they consume homes, induce panic, burn valuables, and force the unlucky few to start over with nothing. With rising temperatures due to global warming, the threat of this only becomes more prevalent and will sadly gain more victims if we do nothing about it. 
<br><br>
 I would like to say that Santa Barbara is generally progressive and in support of moving towards sustainability. I mean, with the abundance of nature from the ocean to the mountains surrounding us, how could one not want to preserve it. With this said, it’s sad that the local government is much more talk than action. In the article, Wilson talked about how local councilmen were more concerned about promising the luxuries of retail stores over local stores and ensuring that the amount of free parking would only increase because these are the factors that get them elected. By increasing available parking, it also raises the chance that people are more likely to drive, and in Santa Barbara, car emissions are the biggest contributor to our greenhouse gas emissions. This in no way helps us move toward a zero-emission lifestyle. As a county, we have the resources and the wealth to enforce change and we can’t afford to ignore that power for our own comfort. Santa Barbara is warming faster than many other parts of the state and if we do nothing, our comfort will be gone regardless.
<br><hr>

I agree with your feelings of being disturbed by this article as well. It was shocking to see Del Playa mentioned and the images of IV's eroding cliffs shown in an article that essentially is about the world's impending doom. Growing up only a mile from the coast, I never experienced extreme weather events, as temperatures where I lived were regulated by the ocean. I always imagined the seriousness of the situation never affecting the Californian coastline, but rather poor countries at sea level, or with already fractured governments that would make them unable to deal with environmentally-caused food shortages. After reading the article, I realize how much of an increase in fire frequency and severity we have experienced in SoCal that I was ignorant of before. While the brunt of climate change will be felt by third world countries, I am opening my eyes to the reality that we too will face drastic and even potentially deadly changes in our own communities.
<br><br>

It was also disturbing to learn how Santa Barbara has been failing to meet its own climate goals, as I see Santa Barbara as a leader in environmental consciousness and activism. It upsets me to realize how deep the influences of the oil industry go, as they have such influence still on such a progressive county. Hopefully in this new year our political leaders will be able to fight back against the influence that the oil industry has, and will make legitimate and effective steps towards becoming more carbon neutral, not only to preserve our local ecosystem and communities, but to set an example for the rest of the world to follow.

This point in the article also stood out to me; everyone raves about the perfect weather in California but with all of the recent fires our once desirable weather is now seen as catastrophic. I am from LA so I would sometimes smell the smoke from wildfires but I had never seen them, until I moved to Santa Barbara. Watching the cave fire flames right outside my dorm was extremely shocking, and scary. As a California native I knew the fires were happening, but for the past few years it never truly hit me until I saw them with my own eyes. My friend who attends Mount Saint Mary’s told me how she woke up early one morning to the sound of her RA; who was banging on all the students’ doors and announcing a mandatory evacuation because of wildfires. My friend was lucky enough to leave in a car, but other students had to carry their belongings and walk down the large hill leading up to the college, while the mountains were on fire. 
<br><br>

As the article points out, climate change has now making fire season year round, and it is affecting animals, crops, and people. Santa Barbara can be seen as hypocritical, because it cares more “about how it looks than how it lives” and is not as progressive as we think. There is simply not enough being done. When my sister told me there was a tornado in Santa Barbara I replied with “there’s no tornadoes in California.” Thankfully it did not hit us, but it did land very close, and never before did I think I’d have to worry about the possibility of tornadoes. The city itself seems very progressive, but as the comment above states we must take action now or the climate will only worsen.

I moved to California for school since 2016, ever since 2016 that there is going to be wildfire every year. As the article mentioned that California does not have wildfires like those before 2016, it is the deteriorating of the climate that leads to the issue. California itself is a warm state and the slight change in temperature costs those natural disasters. The article, also mentions that the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has increased by 2.3 Celcius degrees; and the reason behind the rise of temperature is the motor vehicles in Santa Barbara.
 <br><br>
I do not think this just the issue of Santa Barbara County, it is the whole problem of California. People who live in California must have a car that has become a standard for every Californian. There is no way for people to live without a car in California. Those cars produce Carbon dioxide into the air of California. Especially in Southern California that the usage of the car is more prevalent. Because people have no choice rather than driving by themselves. The public transportation system is terrible and there is no way for people to benefit from public transportation.  The buses and subways are taking too long to wait, which is time-consuming. 
<br><br>
If the California State government spends more money on the development of public transportation and increase its efficiency; I assume that there will be fewer people driving, thus the temperature of California might drop.

I agree with your statement that the inefficiency of California's public transportation system is one of the greatest challenges to the region's rising temperatures. The buses and subways are painstakingly long, making it hard for working citizens to get to their jobs and other obligations in a timely manner. For example, many students at UCSB find jobs downtown because there is more opportunities. Because the bus from Isla Vista to downtown takes about an hour to arrive at a nearby location,  students do not have enough time in the day to travel from class to work and back home via bus. Like mentioned in the article, "2 Degrees Beyond the Limit", Santa Barbra is "considering" getting rid of some of its parking lots to diminish the amount of cars traveling to the area. This is unlikely to fall through because Santa Barbara has a history of talking the environmental talk, without walking the walk. This action would also cause the city to lose money as people are more reluctant to travel to the area. Therefore, the only way this could be successful is if the city revises and renews some of its transportation. If the state of California as a whole does more to provide efficient, and affordable transportation, the amount of cars on the road could decrease considerably. As a result, the smog, bad air quality, and carbon dioxide emissions would also decrease. Therefore, improving public transportation services is an option in which California's politics does not consider enough.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment completely. We can’t expect people to stop driving as it would be impossible for so many people who rely on cars to get them around. The public transportation system in California is awful and we can’t expect people to rely on it alone. I think another solution to this issue is to incentivize more environmentally friendly options. If the most environmentally friendly option is the cheapest/easiest option, everyone will be way more likely to choose that option over anything else. Sadly, money is the biggest motivator in our county, but we can use that to the advantage of our environment if we really want to. Another example of this would be to heavily tax gasoline, as mentioned in the lecture. People might start buying electric cars, or just not buy cars at all if it's too expensive. In addition to this, we could make electric cars cheaper than gas-powered cars. This is already sort of happening as the government gives incentives that lower the price of electric cars for consumers. We can’t trust that every member of our society is going to care about climate change, so we have to find ways to make it easier for everyone to be more environmentally friendly, even if they don’t know they're doing it.

Reading Comment: While there is a proposed goal to keep global warming under 2 degrees of average temperature, people look past the fact that some areas are going to increase by more than just 2 degrees if the average goal is only 2 degrees. This is evident on the central coast which after reading the article I've learned this region has already exceeded the goal and in some counties pushing 3 degrees. In previous articles, we've read that an increase in 2 degrees would cause an endless list of climate change issues and since the central coast has already exceeded the 2-degree mark these issues are surfacing and effecting all life in these areas. Some farmers in the central coast area are having to grow agave now since there is such little water due to climate change which typically is grown in Mexico. This fact was scary to me when I read it because if native crops can't grow where they used to then we'll experience a shortage of many crops. Not only will there be a shortage of crops but prices will increase for crops since there's less of them. While an increase in price for crops wouldn't largely affect most, it may mean for individuals of lower-economic standing can't afford to buy these crops that may be apart of their primary diet. Climate change isn't something that will affect one or two aspects of our life but something that is going to affect every aspect. 
<br><br>
A takeaway from this article I had was the irony of how Santa Barbara was the birthplace of the earth day movement yet the city is resistant to making large changes toward less greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically when Santa Barbara in the article said it wouldn't get rid of parking infrastructure because of its profitability. This is frustrating to me because I feel government officials aren't willing to give up a paycheck to ensure we have Earth we can hand down to our children and not be ashamed of. I feel like all the impacts on the region like drought, fires, and mudslides would be enough to show the urgency of climate change especially when these disasters are happening to our community. If officials keep ignoring what's in front of them these disasters will begin to intensify and become more frequent and we'll look back at the officials and blame them for not taking action while we could've dampened the effects.

I found your assessment of the potential dangers of climate change interesting as you mentioned in your comment that not only will an increase of 2 degrees Celsius cause massive ecologically damage but economical damage will add to the disasters that come as a result of climate change. I find it very ironic that the people who are trying to protect natural gas and oil companies due to the benefits it contributes the economy may actually be hurting the economy in the long run because by poisoning the Earth with petroleum products they are in fact hurting other natural resources that we extract, plants, lumber, and animals. Therefor like Levi stated a decrease in these other resources will cause price hikes for commodities we commonly see as low price, abundant goods.
<br><br>
One thing I learned from the article is the correlation between the amount of parking a cities has and the number of cars that are used in that city. It is logical to think that the more cars that are made the more parking spots there would be however, the reverse of this makes a little less sense. The article states that the more abundant parking is people are more likely to purchase cars as it become easier to go from location to location knowing you will have somewhere to park. Something I am fearful about is that Santa Barbara county and the surrounding areas will become the test subjects for the dramatic effect of climate change and that we will become a place where retroactive actions are taken to curb climate change once it has already gotten to a point of no return. I would rather act proactively and stop the problem before it effects our home worse than it already has.

Having never spent much time in Southern California until starting school here in September, I was extremely shocked by this reading. Mainly because in Northern California I wasn't experiencing the drastic increase in temperature as well as the intense rainstorms that led to mudslides. I had previously thought of California as a perfect mix between climates but now after living in different regions of California I can honestly say that I am starting to see the effects of climate change. Walking along the beach below Del Playa is a little scary. The balcony's and the eroding cliffs aren't a good match and after hearing about the balcony that collapsed during winter break, I'll be sure to be careful when walking along the beach now. 
  <br><br>
The increasing temperature and cliff erosion isn't the only thing that the article brought to my attention, but the increasing wildfires is by far the most worrisome issue. I live in Napa where in the past few years fires have become the new normal. But when my parents were younger they rarely ever saw a wildfire ever come close to their houses. Not only are wildfires becoming larger and are occurring more often, but they are simply becoming welcomed. No one seems to be questioning why they are occurring more often. I don't understand how there are still climate deniers out there when there is so much evidence right in our faces.

I too as a NorCal resident did not know about events happening in SoCal. I knew of the Thomas Fire, but did not really know, or care too much, about it at the time. I agree with you on the point about DP's houses: seeing the teetering houses is kind of scary. As I elaborate on later in my comment, I agree with the points you make completely. 

  <br><br>

Listening to Ken's video, as well as reading the article has only recently made me realize the extent of the Thomas Fire. In 2017, I was still in high school in the Bay Area. I had heard about the Thomas Fire, and I paid some attention because I intended on going here to UCSB, but I had no idea of the extent of the devastation. Ken said in the video that the fire spanned 281,000 acres and was the largest wildfire to date in California. What Ken stated in the video about ridiculously high midday temperatures rings true with my experiences. A few years ago, it reached 114 degrees in September in my hometown. I distinctly remember illegally driving my friends home (I had not had my license for over a year), because it was too hot for them to walk. At the time I was very worried I would get pulled over by a police officer, but now I am realizing that my bigger concern should have been about the environment. What Ken said about California being what the Roman’s called ‘a pleasant place’ was a major influence in my parents’ decision to move to California from India. 
  <br><br>

Reading about how the apartments on DP will be unsustainable due to the cliffs eroding was eye opening and kind of terrifying. Knowing that a place I nearly ended up living in will be gone in a few decades will be gone due to climate change made an issue that seemed remote, vividly real. Reading about the fires made me think of how earlier last year there was massive disruption in the San Francisco Bay Area when PG&E had to cut power numerous times due to fire risk. That event even led to the casualty of an old man who needed the power to power his respirator. These kinds of events should be unacceptable.
<br><hr>
Thank you for sharing and I find myself agreeing to everything you have covered in your comment! I am from southern California and it is really beyond simple coincidences that extreme weather patterns and events are becoming more and more frequent down here each year that they are unfortunately starting to become the norm. I remember when I saw the news coverage of the Thomas Fire on the television a couple of years ago and just thinking to myself, "How in the world is a natural disaster, a forest wildfire on such a massive scale and so destructive, possible in the world today? I wonder who set this up?" But again, that was just a natural reaction and an afterthought in reaction to the news, and I did not spend much time considering the serious cause and effects of the fire. Moreover, I did not see that the Thomas Fire was just one of the many alarms the planet is sending out to us humans to warn us of the damage we had done to our environment and that there will only be more devastating and destructive natural hazards from now on into the future. Now after reading the article and watching professor Hiltner's lecture video, the answer to my question is more than obvious: us humans are responsible for causing all of these natural disasters due to anthropogenic activities in recent decades that unapologetically exploited our planet and the natural resources through deforestation, overfishing, grazing of cattle and other livestock that severely depleted the lands, excessive use, and extraction of fossil fuels pumping millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and many more. Now the consequences of our actions leading to climate change are arriving one after one, and ironically we can only pay attention and truly see the issue of climate change when it is starting to actually negatively affect our personal daily lives and literally hitting us straight in our faces while our planet and our environment have endured our unfair exploitation and depletion for so long until now.

<br><hr>
Living in souther California for all of my life, it is interesting to hear what it is like to enter this environment at this time of recurring and severe natural disasters. While it is a bit of a "norm" around here as far as experiencing wildfires and preparing for evacuations, it is a crazy thing to personally experience so often, especially when it is a new experience for you altogether. Wildfires are a scary and unpredictable disaster as discussed in the article, but when we name their cause to be the change in our climate that humans have created, treating these fires as "unpreventable" is foolish. The increase in their frequency is a result of the drier, warmer climate we have created for ourselves. And the fact that it is a local issue that is still not enacting change is almost... comical. One would think if your city was about to burn that perhaps it would be time to take action: fight against oil drilling, ride your bike (!!!!), and support the farmers who are doing their part to reduce the amount of water they are using for their agriculture to prevent further drying of our climate. Yet the article points out Santa Barbara's love for free parking (which I frequently enjoy as well) and southern California's unreasonable appreciation for the thirsty avocado is still taking priority over the promise to reduce 2007 emission levels by 15%. To the "green electorate" who still is working on all their oil projects and Santa Barbara locals who are normalizing wildfires, there will be TONS of free parking when the city burns up.
  <br><br>

In response to the fear of falling cliffs in Isla Vista, I say sure, sea levels are rising as the ocean warms... but whoever built the oceanside houses on Del Playa were far more concerned with money signs than logic. Climate change aside, erosion happens everywhere!! Those houses are bound to disappear regardless!! Sea level change happens naturally!! The climate change may be causing that change at a more rapid rate, but all of our favorite party balconies are going to become ocean litter eventually even if humans didn't being industrialization 400 years ago. It's frustrating to see this as a climate crisis argument so often when instead it should be a condemnation of greedy and unintelligent neighborhood planning. It's beautiful to live on the ocean, but it's a dumb place to invest money and energy into as it will disappear regardless. Let's stop worrying about how our recycling will affect our local cliffs and focus more on the failing political aspect of this entire issue.

<br><hr>

 you took the words right out of my mouth! I had never REALLY put into perspective the dangers that could occur while I live here at the beach until I read this article. The introduction of this article was extremely daunting as the two worst fires have occurred in the last two years. The Coastal fires have occurred from Santa Barbara to San Diego. This fact wouldn’t normally have bothered me as I am from the Bay Area, but on the second read I realized, “oh shoot I’m in Santa Barbara.” It said that people have been packing up their belongings, and preparing for wildfire season. This seems a little bit exaggerated. It just seems hard to believe that families living in high risk areas have all their valuables always packed up in case of a fire. 
  <br><br>

Reading the fact about how the number of hot days will double by 2050 is not good. I am already hot everyday since I have moved in. If that is true, I recommend UCSB start putting in air conditioning systems! One thing that I liked reading about was when they were discussing the conversations that were being had with neighbors. I think they were asking the things that need to be asked. Finding out who has horses, and who needs help is making an evacuation plan that is needed. As the movie introduced, the person that is best to plan an evacuation plan for you is you. The neighbors are now becoming prepared and that is one of the only positives I read.

Being a resident of Southern California all of my life and more specifically a resident of Los Angeles ,I find all your experience of climate change very interesting. Los Angeles' air is very polluted mainly do the amount of vehicles on our roads, as well as the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, and not only that but the industries in Los Angeles also contribute to the air pollution. All of these are the main contributors to the rise in temperatures in Southern California and the reason for the sharp temperature increase which has led to wild fires that have just became part of Southern California lifestyle. It is fascinating how even though we are both residents of California that our experiences can be so different as of right now. I am sure the more trees and other vegetation in Northern California are the reason because they absorb some of the carbon dioxide that is emitted in their photosynthetic process. 
  <br><br>

Our new reality of wild fires and increase in temperature is extremely sad. and frightening  From where I am from it is very visible how much Southern California has been effected by climate change, due to that I live very close the Hacienda Hills and when I was very young they were always a beautiful vibrant green and slowly they have morphed into a lifeless hills of dirt. These Hills as climate continues to rise will be very susceptible to fires which is very nerve racking because of how close they are to the house that I have grown up in. 
  <br><br>

In Ken's video he mens the new threat of the rising probability of tornadoes occurring in Southern California, namely, Santa Barbra county. What is particularly worrisome to me about this, and I am sure many others as well, is Southern California homes in comparison to midwest homes (where tornadoes are more usual) are not built in anyway in preparation for tornadoes, they lack things like bunkers. Therefore, in the event of a tornado Californians in the path are more at risk for danger. This is a very scary thought.
<br><hr>

 I agree with you about your comment. Thank you for sharing what you covered such as increasing temperature and cliff erosion. I have been studied in Southern California for seven years. At the beginning, I didn't notice about the wildfires. Later in the last four years, I can see the wildfires happened annually in either northern or southern California. Wildfires happen more and more often. I remembered that there was a fire in Anaheim, and one of my friends home was burned. Because of the increasing temperature and dry climates, the fire can destroy someone's home or even worse. The fire can bring a lot of losses to one's family. I personally felt very worried about the future climate. I wonder that if the climate crisis continue in a fast speed, what will the consequences be? 
  <br><br>
In last quarter, I personally saw the wildfires around my apartment. At night, I saw the fire light up the sky. Our school even stopped class because of the air condition. The climate crisis actually happen around me right now.
<br><hr>
hank you so much for sharing your experience. Similar to your background, I have not lived in California long enough to feel the difference brought to us by climate change. However, the recent wildfire happened in Santa Barbara is definitely a warning from nature. This is the first time when I feel that the climate crisis is more than a topic in the textbook. The Thomas fire has inspired me to pay more attention to our surroundings. As I look into the climate crisis again, I realized that wildfire is only the tip of an iceberg. For instance, four-season have vanished in my home country. We no longer have winter, spring, and autumn. All year-round, the climate is warm and humid. During "winter," the weather is just slightly cooler than summer. This is completely different from when I was a kid. I can still remember those days when I wore a down jacket in the winter......
<br><br>
Seeing all these happen. I doubt that if we could keep the climate below 2 degrees Celsius.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that it’s crazy to see climate deniers still out there. Not to mention the fact that California, the state that is known to have the beautiful beaches with palm trees and not a care in the world, is experiencing crazy disasters that we’ve never been faced before. But I think the fact that we do live in California and have cultivated this luxurious, materialistic lifestyle is the very reason why people here try so hard to deny that the climate crisis is real and that it’s what’s causing the destruction of our homes. When we think about how we approach these disasters, it’s more a retroactive reaction when it happens that we just have to pull all our money out to fix and move on. But no one thinks to use that money instead to take preventative measures because it will likely infringe on the way we live here and our lifestyles. 
<br><br>

Climate deniers in this area exist I believe because the weight of the issue only numbs people even more. People live their luxurious lives without having to care about this “invisible” issue. But in this article it’s clear that there is a class divide to those that are most and least impacted. The people most impacted are the ones whose livelihoods depend on the land that’s being destroyed around us. I think it’s incredibly sad that it must be this way, but unless the more privileged people start to feel just as affected by those farmers, and lower income communities, they will still be in denial.

I often hear climate crisis deniers claim, “How could the climate crisis be real if I cant ever see it in my real day-to-day life”. Not only is this an extremely narcissistic ideology, but it is also false for anyone to say if they attend UCSB or live in Southern california. This article highlights how climate change if majorly affecting one of the wealthiest and nicest climates in the world. The article describes the countless examples of how severe weather such as droughts and wildfires Whether its from getting tar on your feet, evacuating from a fire, buying pricey fruit, or being hotter outside, everyone is being affected. This article demonstrates how if you live in So-Cal you have been and will continue to be increasingly affected by the climate crisis whether you acknowledge it or not. Not only has it been bad, but it is only going to get worse as time goes on. If this is how bad it is now, imagine in 20-50 years. As someone who has lived in Southern California my whole life, I was shocked to read that  this area is experiencing double the heating rate of continental US. 

<br><br>

Reading how Santa Barbara county claimed they were going to reduce CO2 levels, but then actually just increased demonstrates a huge problem with actually bringing about change in society. It is easy to get people to “vote” or say they want to decrease their carbon footprint because it takes no actual work or sacrifice to just say that. When actually faced with what they would have to do on a lifestyle basis, even the most staunch climate change supporters will fall short and not make the necessary sacrifices. People will claim they want to reduce their carbon footprint, but will continually fail to stop eating meat, drive a more efficient car, or buy less items. If someone goes vegetarian they cut their carbon footprint by more than half, and even more if you drive an electric or hybrid car. This is a simple and easy decision to make that each person has full ownership over, and almost nobody makes it…. which is a testament to how much they actually care.

<br><br>

I really enjoyed Ken's lecture on it as well. He does a great job explaining how rising sea level is not the only threat of the climate crisis. This is a idea that alot of people struggle with, and he does a stellar job explaining it.

As someone who has also lived in Southern California their whole life, I was completely shocked to know that Southern California is heating at a rate double of continental US. I was never really aware of the extreme dangers Southern California was facing until after reading this article. Southern California as we know it is being transformed as the climate grows hotter, which causes drier regions due to wind, more intense fires, horrific mudslides, and extreme droughts. This article does a great job highlighting how the climate crisis is increasingly affecting the Southern California areas. The article specifically focuses on the Santa Barbara area that we are all familiar with. I was shocked to learn that since 1895, the county of Ventura has been faced with the quickest growing temps in the lower 48 states. The Paris agreement that Obama signed while in office agreed that we would keep the temps well below 2 degrees of increase. However, Ventura has already increased by 2.6 degrees. I would have never thought Ventura would be facing the fastest temp increase, and instead would have imagined it to be LA or Orange County. Many people assume that the Santa Barbara area would be taking necessary action to help reduce this climate increase since Santa Barbara was the birthplace of modern environmental movement. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara is not meeting its own antipollution goals. In 2015, Santa Barbara stated they were going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% compared with 2007 levels. However, rather than reducing the emissions, Santa Barbara exceeded them by 14%. The article raises the question, “if a place with Santa Barbara’s predominantly green electorate and political class is unwilling to change, who will?”. This question honestly scared me because of how true it is. Santa Barbara is supposed to serve as a model for many others. If Santa Barbara can’t make a change, how is it going to be possible for anyone else to? Santa Barbara conducts inventory of greenhouse gas emissions once every three years, and the Climate Action Plan states no regulations on businesses and individuals. These regulations are simply just words written on a piece of paper that aren’t enforcing anyone to make a change. We always say we are going to try and reduce the climate increase, but never end up doing anything about it. If no one is here forcing us to fix this mess, it will never be fixed and Southern California will be demolished.

<br><hr>

In agreement with the following comment, I too believe that many people who claim they want to help the climate change crisis, most likely end up failing in their proposed solutions. People are so quick to talk and say they will change but do not follow through with action, which is, unfortunately, the sadness of it all. Reading the assigned article, I knew that there have been several devastating fires in the surrounding areas in the past years but was not informed how threatening they were and are to everyone as well. Something that stuck out to me while reading the article was the fact that in a recent study of the Santa Barbara- area climate said that the number of awfully hot days is likely to double by 2050. It is known that these temperatures are projected to rise, which means the climate crisis is only going to get worse as time progresses. Several people are unfortunately oblivious to what is going on and do not realize what the consequences can get to if change does not happen. 
<br><br>

I can admit I stand with the people that say they will change but do not follow through. Although I live in Southern California, I do not live near most of the fires that took place in the past couple of years, which is why it is easier for me to just say I will help but will not since I am not experiencing what those who are going through many changes and even having to relocate or deal with damaged homes due to these fires. Now that I attend UCSB and live here, after reading this article, I realized that I can be apart of those residents and students that faced struggles due to these fires. I think it is important to inform many UCSB students of these surrounding fires and their lasting effects so they can maybe help and perhaps change their lifestyle and come up with possible solutions and they can then spread them to their families and friends as well, urging them to help this climate crisis.

Being a senior at UCSB, I have experienced all the recent natural disasters in Santa Barbara County. Reading through each of the stories within the article by the Washington Post I can find a specific memory relating to each event. My sophomore year during the Thomas Fire, I remember skating over to UCSB's Student Health to grab a 3MM face mask to protect myself from all the particulates in the air. At the time, UCSB had just cancelled all finals and was telling students to evacuate the area. It was a harrowing experience but I remember thinking to myself that what are the odds of this happening here in Santa Barbara. Well, low and behold it happened again the following year in Malibu (Woolsey Fire) that had smoke traveling up to Santa Barbara County. Then, most recently the Cave Fire which threw everyone into a mini-panic. There is a repetitive pattern to these events that doesn't seem to be slowing down.
<br><br>

It is absolutely ridiculous to see how fast the climate around us is changing. We are getting a first-hand account of the disastrous effects of climate change right here at UCSB. Is the two degree celsius increase actively drying out Santa Barbara County and providing the fuel for another fire or is it a culmination of consequences from our general lack respect for our environment? I would like to say it is the latter, however, I do not believe there is a right answer. The scariest part of the Washington Post article was the statement on Santa Barbara's green-focused community but lack of follow through with any environmental decisions. Especially given the recent events in the area it is disappointing to see the lack of change in the community.

I also relate to experiencing the recent natural disasters. I remember the hazy red sky, the ash landing on my clothes, and the smell of smoke invading my dorm. I remember finals being postponed, and I could leave from the smoky city to a city with clear skies and fresh air. I reflected on how this fire grew to the size that it did, and concluded it was largely influenced by climate change. Turning off powerlines is only a temporary solution, and doesn’t address the root of the cause – humans. As temperature increases and the climate becomes more arid, fires have the ability to run rampant, and will only become more difficult to distinguish. The current trend of natural disasters in California is distressing. The Thomas Fire displayed a large warning sign that unless humans act on decreasing their environmental impact, fires like the Thomas Fire will no longer be a warning, but the norm.
 <br><br>

I also want to recognize the loss of livestock and crops due to climate change is not surprising, though something I considered very little. All animals have a threshold of the amount of heat that can be transferred to their systems, and once that threshold is surpassed, their systems begin to shut down. Similarly, high temperature and lack of water kills crops. Though crops that are resilient to heat and desiccation may be a short term solution for farmers, as temperatures continue to rise and water becomes scarcer, those crops will not be sustainable long term. These issues are quite complex, which perhaps explains why a solution has yet to be made.

I have the exact similar experience with you. As a student living in Santa Barbara, I find the article closely related to my own life. The marine life in beautiful ocean that we see everyday is continuing decline. Also, the changing natural world fundamentally influence the social activities such as farming and electricity. I am strongly shocked by the fire in December, 2019, which could be seen from my home and our school. Many of my friends have received the evacuation notice and helicopters came to extinguish the fire. Honestly, I have never imagined that anthropogenic climate change could bring such huge damage until I saw the mountain fire myself. The article indicates the similar experience of Terri Bowman, the manager of a camping resort, who said that the wildfire has been an annual event since 2016. The less coastal moisture and more risk of fire make me worried about the future of our hometown. Moreover, the article indicates that the biggest contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emission in Santa Barbara County is the car. Since I always depend on the car to travel and go to school, I feel sorry for the pollution that I have caused. But at the same time, I believe that this is also related to political issue—Santa Barbara council should make some effective regulations about electricity and oil projects to decrease environmental pollution. The article incorporates multiple interviews of citizens, orchard owners, environmentalists, and politicians to demonstrate that climate change is a complex issue which requires mutual efforts.

After reading your comment and its replies, it amazed me just how many of us have been directly impacted by the ramifications of climate change during the past few years. I personally witnessed the impacts of wildfires two years ago, when I spent two weeks backpacking through Yosemite National Park. That summer, the Detwiler fire spread from Mariposa throughout Northern California, and the smoke quickly engulfed Yosemite. The smoke was omnipresent; I woke up each morning to the coughing of my fellow backpackers and to soot coating my sleeping bag. 

 <br><br>

After I came home, I researched air quality and learned that according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 91% of the world’s population resides in areas where the air quality violates WHO guidelines. I realized that a large portion of the human population lives with the poor air quality similar to what I briefly experienced while I was backpacking during the fire. As I am writing this comment, the Air Quality Index in Delhi is 309 ppm and is classified as hazardous. I cannot imagine what is going to happen to the air quality of places like Delhi if we continue with business as usual. 

 <br><br>

I was also surprised to learn that the Thomas fire in 2017 and Montecito landslide in 2018 collectively caused more than two billion dollars in damage. This stood out to me because many opponents of the Green New Deal or other climate change legislation cite its high cost as a primary reason they oppose it. However, this article makes clear that the cost required for current action will be trivial in comparison to the costs required to adapt to the impacts of climate change in the future.

As a sophomore that currently attends UCSB, I have never experienced a fire nearby until the week of Thanksgiving. That day, I woke up with smoke throughout my apartment and it was getting hard to breathe. I also walk to classes so while walking, I could barely breathe because the smoke was getting so thick. I wasn’t supposed to go home until the next day but it became so bad to the point where classes were canceled and everyone left SB. I have heard about the fires from upperclassmen but I never experienced it first hand and I was so scared that the fire would hit the campus. I understand some of your traumatic experiences and I also thought what are the odds it’ll hit SB? If it does, we can just all get our degrees already. But the closer the fire was to the campus, the more I feared for everyone who was still in SB.
 <br><br>


As I was reading the article, I became saddened by the fact that houses on DP are slowly crumbling due to the ocean rising. My upperclassmen friends currently live in a house on DP and the view there looks really nice but I didn’t know that some house requires concrete columns in order to be supported. This caused me to worry about the safety of current residents and what could possibly happen to them if their house does collapse.
<br><hr>
As A Third year I have also experienced all of the recent natural disasters. I distinctly remember the Thomas Fire. My freshman year when the fire started I remember my floor mates in FT freaking out; there was ash falling from the sky to the point it looked like it had snowed, the power was being shut on and off, all of the elevators were blocked off, and the campus looked apocalyptic. To me this was normal. I was calm, didn’t feel the need to wear a face mask, and when the campus was shut down I had to say because my flight wasn’t scheduled until the next week. I have grown up in very northern California, the part of California where it snows (well used to snow more), but where there have also been very bad forest fires since I was about eight. The most recent scare was the Camp fire which came very close to where I live and many of my friends lost their homes. Spending the summers in smoke; training for sports in gymnasiums, and ash falling from the sky, and being evacuated from my house has become a norm.
  <br><br>

As you pointed out what really struck me in the article was how fast the environment is changing. Each year it feels as if the fire risk becomes exponentially worse, in California and in specific, Ventura county. Growing up in California we have witnessed climate change firsthand, not only in fires but in the after math of the fire such as mud slides, and in the buildup, such as the lack of snow pack and precipitation causing more severe droughts. 
  <br><br>

I agree that what was one of the scariest parts of the article was how green oriented Ventura county is, while simultaneously no action has been taken recently. The line that really struck me was “there is no teeth in the plan, no one is there to enforce it.” When is the point going to be reached where people living lavishly are going to compromise a little bit of their comfort and ease for the good of the planet? What is it going to take to have people take action when no one is looking? I find myself getting frustrated that individuals must have an incentive in order to act for the good of the planet, instead of just taking action because it in the right thing to do.

I have the same feeling as you. For the period of cave fire during the final week of Fall 2019, I saw the blazing fire on the nearby mountain. It was the first time that I experienced such a wide fire at UCSB. All lectures at our campus are cancelled. I also receive a message from the SBCC who announced that its campus will be closed for the week in case any student encountered a danger. Santa Barbara county has experienced several fires over couple of years, which have made pollution to this city.

  <br><br>

After the cave fire, I do not see any changes in lifestyle around us. We live like before, as if there is no fire occurs in the last few days. Even though most of us do not actually take care of the place we are living in, however, there a group of firefighters in Santa Barbara who make all their efforts to make containment to this cave fire and achieved zero injuries in this severe cave fire. While the investigator is looking for the cause of this fire, I believe that the dry weather in Santa Barbara County plays an important role in the trigger of the fire. Most natural disasters happen in California are due to the climate change, and the climate change is a result of human activities. What we should do to protect the environment are not so clear, but there should be some works to be done for the climate in Santa Barbara.

<br><hr>
This week’s article made everything we had learned so far feel a little more real. The fact that climate change has severely impacted the area in which I am living in and writing this very comment serves as even more of a call for action. It came as a surprise to me (although it really shouldn’t have) that an apartment on DP crumbled to the ocean below only three years ago and that there are many more apartments that could soon follow. 
  <br><br>


While listening to Ken’s comments on the increase of fires in California, I thought back to November, when I was driving home for Thanksgiving and saw a bright red spot surrounded by huge patches of black in the mountains. I had seen the Cave Fire in pictures all over social media, but when I saw it with my own eyes, it was startlingly real. 
  <br><br>


Then I read your comment and realized that someone only a few years older than me was here for so many of the other events. I can’t even imagine how frightening the rest of them must have been. I feel that Wilson’s article as well as many of our own experiences make it unquestionably clear that climate change is real, that it is here, and that we NEED to take action NOW.

  <br><br>

I also definitely share your worry regarding Santa Barbara’s lack of actually making impactful environmental decisions. This means that Santa Barbara probably considers themselves as a community who is already contributing to the fight against climate change and therefore feels that they are already doing their part, when in reality, that is not the case. Plans to improve policies are just words until they are put into action, and I hope to see that a community that presents themselves as so green-focused will realize that soon.
<br><hr>
To start off, I wanted to say that I really appreciated that you shared your personal experience and emotions attached to this subject matter. It really brought a different voice color to your response and even adds another layer of depth to the severity of everything discussed through this reading. The article and what was addressed felt just that much more real. As you have mentioned, being a senior at UCSB, you really have gone through all the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Santa Barbara. The Thomas Fire happened just a year before I entered as a freshman, and even then, I had heard from many upperclassmen how the incident hit home for many of them, affecting their lives back home nearby as well as school, the air quality, and much more. The fact that Santa Barbara (and the Ventura area) specifically is drawn out to be one of the worst case scenarios showing drastic temperature rise against the Paris Agreement that we originally were apart of as a nation, is a shocker. Knowing that during that short period of time that I left Santa Barbara to go home for break, that there was a tornado warning, is crazy to think about. Here of all places, a tornado?
  <br><br>

I agree that it does seem ridiculous to see how fast the climate is changing around us, especially since it is literally happening before our eyes, and even more prominently in places where we call home and our campus. As professor Hiltner stated, with 800 miles of coastline and the majority of a population of 40 million living along these coastlines, the effects are immense as we all start to realize that these temperature rises are causing all sorts of unpredictable weather and environmental conditions (such as tornadoes, storms, sudden hot-cold changes, etc.). The effects, having hit so close to us under our noses, should be enough of a wakeup call to get us moving. Something else you said that I also thought of, is what were the chances that all these things are happening right here, in Santa Barbara? It won’t just be our city at some point, and will spread more prominently to other parts of California, because it really is here. Raising awareness on our campus and in our city would be a great place to start, just like through courses like this that we are taking.

I too was unaware of the climate change danger we face here in Santa Barbara and hearing how much we contribute to said climate change was appalling. I was previously aware of the devastating fires this county has encountered and the life-threatening mudslides that are prone to occur after said fires but I did not realize that since the Paris Conference Santa Barbara temperatures have raised 2 degree celsius. As a "green" county I was shocked that Santa Barbara was not doing more to assist the United States in becoming more friendly and understanding of the green economy, but instead they contribute to the fasting rising temperature in the area besides Ventura. It was interesting to hear Ken discuss how no-one asks him about climate change because they already know its here...I too wonder why people understand that the world is being corrupted by human life but they do not want to make a difference in their lifestyles nor their states to change the carbon footprint they are leaving.
  <br><br>

I also agree that I believe people should talk about possible disasters to come in order to stay safe and learn how to handle the impending weather patterns. I was surprised to hear that Santa Barbara was being affected the most by climate change but it did not surprise me that California should be more fearful of fires than of the sea/ocean rising. I knew that most Californians lived by the coast and in fire hazard zones, but I did not realize that 1/4 of California was in a high fire risk zone and that the coastal cities running from Santa Barbara to San Diego have had 4 of the 5 worst fires in the past half century in the last 2 decades. I think that people should communicate with their families and discuss what they would do in the event of a deadly fire. Also, I think that people need to be more fearful of climate change because even just altering one aspect of their life could drastically change their carbon footprint and slightly help the atmosphere.

I agree, families should discuss a plan for any natural disaster emergency. Just recently we experienced earthquakes and my family was discussing exit strategies and made bags of necessities to keep close by. The weird thing is that after a few days we went back to normal and continued to live the same way as before the earthquake. While I don’t think we should necessarily be consumed by the idea of a natural disaster I do think it is important to make changes. I think of it as if someone were to experience a heart attack or be told they have an illness and continue to live the same way without any dietary changes. I feel like we should not wait for the big earthquake or fire to hit in order for us to makes changes because by then it will be too late. I agree people need to make changes in their lives that can result in drastic changes to their carbon footprint.

While reading the article I was thinking about how unaware I was of the danger of climate change where I live. I did not know we were so strongly affected by it here in Santa Barbara and began to think about what would happen during an emergency. 
  <br><br>
I think the quotes from people that were interviewed for the article were interesting as they also noted that climate change is already affecting them and could be seen by just taking a look outside their house. It is interesting because with the acknowledgement of climate change happening already, action to make earth a sustainable place and occurring quickly enough. It’s as if the fear is not pushing people to start living a more sustainable life. To see how it has affected one of the residences for students is what made me think that we are not taking enough action to reverse the damage we have done. 
  <br><br>

I thought the neighbors from the article were a hope that people do care at least about others and if the time comes to help each other people will. I think it is important to have more conversations like the one they had so that we can all be better prepared and have a plan in case something were to occur.

I also didn't quite realize the drastic effects of climate change here in Santa Barbara! I've seen the warning signs around the cliffsides and saw how quickly people reacted to the fire just last Thanksgiving, but I just never put two and two together. I've lived in Southern California for most of my life, and I was just accustomed to the signs of drastic climate change: yearly fires, scorchingly hot days, tar on the beaches, insane drought, etc. , but it is worrying to know that these are not individual events, but part of a much, much larger issue.
<br><br>

It's also very comforting to know that people are acknowledging climate change in their own backyards, and having conversations about the preparations that need to be made in the event a climate disaster does occur. On the contrary, the fact that Santa Barbara's Climate Action Plan is not being enforced, and is really just for show. This parallels the Paris Agreement to me, as it too is just a list of rules, with no way of being enforced or taken seriously. It's really worrying that we are "pretending" to help the climate to look sustainable, but are not practicing what we preach. I don't understand the disconnect. 

<br><br>
Maybe the fear of impending fires, droughts, erosion of the sea-cliffs, tornado threats, and scorched farmland will create a larger movement, and create a larger conversation about the necessity of climate awareness. The desensitization to irregular climate patterns also needs to be addressed, ie "Oh, Southern California is just hot! It's a desert!". I was definitely unaware of the causes of these disasters, and I am grateful to now be educated about them.
<br><hr>
I feel the same way. I thought of the events individually but once you look at the big picture you start to understand that this is a problem that needs to be addressed by everyone. 
<br><br>
Not knowing that the disasters were out of the ordinary is what made me oblivious to how serious climate change is affecting us and this class has educated me as well of how important the issue is! 
<br><br>
You also have a very good point that Santa Barbara’s plan and the Paris agreement are not enough and more talk than action.
